          - p: For that, cast EB with Bennett, switch to the character imbued with Cryo and
              walk on Bennett's Burst field
          - p: >
              Upon entering burst field, the Pyro status will continuously imbue
              you with Pyro, reacting with other elements on you and eventually
              removing them.

                Pyro Damage Bonus will always be the best for cup. The combo for the highest Melt/Vaporize damage is The Black Sword and EM sand.

                 as it allows Bennett to accomplish 2 things: 
                1) Rapidly spam E for raw pyro damage + overload

                in the Spiral Abyss. This comp is generally only recommended for
                those with Beidou on C2/C6.
              - b: It's worth noting that the main-stat artifacts you want to farm for 4-TF
                  Bennett varies from the main-stat artifacts you'd normally go
                  for in other builds. Instead of ATK/EM, Pyro, and Crit, you'd
                  instead want to go for EM/Pyro/EM on a 4-TF Bennett.
              - " As such, this also means weapons that have EM substats such as
                Iron sting take priority over other swords."
          - p:
              - >-
                It is also worth noting that with 4 TF, Primordial Jade Cutter
                is able to overtake MIstsplitter Reforged due to its massive
                Crit Rate% substat, which allows you to vape consistently
                despite the lack of Crit Dmg/Crit Rate subs in your artifacts.
                This assumes that your EM mainstat pieces (sands, goblet, and
                circlet) lack Crit Rate substats. However, in the rare occasion
                that your EM pieces manage to roll plenty of Crit subs,
                Mistsplitter easily overtakes Jade Cutter.

                Recommended amount of ER%: 130-150%. Worth noting that 
              - b: with Thundering Fury (4), you have a lot more leeway when it comes to ER.

                  turns all of your melee on-field character's Auto Attacks into
                  Pyro, which means that Bennett will lose a lot of his team

                  Regarding Weapon Choices:
                  Mistsplitter Reforged, Aquila Favonia:
              - >2
                 These weapons have the highest Base ATK in the game which is why it is ranked quite high. It is assuming you have enough Energy Recharge so you still can burst off cooldown for the maximum ATK buff.
              - b: "Freedom-Sworn:"
              - >2
                 In comps where Bennett can reliably trigger reactions (and thus trigger this sword's passive), the buffs provided by this weapon will be stronger than Aquila Favonia.
              - b: "The Alley Flash: "
              - >
                This weapon currently has the highest Base ATK for a 4 star
                weapon (even more Base ATK than some 5 stars like Skyward
                Blade).
              - b: "Prototype Rancour: "
              - This weapon has one of the highest Base ATK for a 4 Star weapon
                (and this is also a weapon you could craft from the Blacksmith)

        tips:
          - p: Xinyan's ES grants you a pyro status upon contact with shield. No matter how
              many times you switch your characters, it'll still apply pyro
              every instant you switch with shield. This allows you to cleanse
              every single elemental status that has been applied to you.
          - p: If the status doesn't get cleansed, switch on that character one more time
              with the shield. Pyro doesn't cleanse Hydro very efficiently, take
              Cecilia Garden for example, you'll have to apply pyro on your
              character 4 times before actually cleansing the hydro status.

          Yanfei's Ascension 4 Talent does a second hit after a Crit Charge
          Attack. This scales 80% of your ATK and can trigger reactions as well
          due to having a separate internal cooldown on its pyro application. 
        notes:
          - p: Yanfei can have trouble trying to set up for her reaction DPS. Vaporize is
              generally the more consistent option and you need Xingqiu to make
              this work best. When running a Vaporize team with Xingqiu, 3
              normal attacks into a charged attack (N1>N2>N3>C) is the safest
              and most reliable way to vaporize your charged attacks. Make sure

              - b: "Retracing Bolide (4): "
              - Running Yanfei with a shield character also allows you to make
                use of a full Retracing Bolide 4-set as a placeholder until
                you're able to find a good Crimson Witch 4-set.

                  Regarding Artifact Substats Priority: 
              - Energy Recharge is prioritized over Elemental Mastery here since
                she has an 80 energy burst cost while her skill is also not very
                efficient at generating particles for getting it back. A major
                source of your energy will be coming from enemies as well as
                potential pyro batteries like Bennett, so be sure to have her
                pick the particles up as off-field characters only get 0.6x the
                value of the particles.

                Generally the best go to set for Diluc due to how easily Diluc
                can stack the Pyro Damage effect, while his burst imbues his
                Normal/Charged Attacks with Pyro.

                  Regarding Main Stats Choice:
              - If Diluc is run alongside Xingqiu where he can trigger vaporize
                very often, you can run EM sands as an alternative to ATK sands.
                EM boosts Diluc's reaction damage by a lot after all. Note that
                when Diluc's Pyro imbued basic attack is active, he can trigger
                Vaporize every 2 basic attacks due to internal cooldown.

        tips: Klee's Attacks have a 50% chance of spawning a floating star. Floating
          star removes the stamina cost for the next Charged Attack and
          increases 50% of its damage.
        notes:
          - p: Extremely squishy, Klee requires great positioning. Being tiny, this is hard
              to achieve. Constant jumping during your Charged Attacks can help.

                actual practise as it requires you to dodge more and consume

              cancel the last charged attack, the Elemental Burst will still

        notes:
          - p: Hu Tao is most effective when used with Xingqiu to proc Vaporize/Freeze Melt
              reactions which utilizes her BiS Set, Crimson Witch of Flames (4).
              Freeze Melt refers to freezing enemies for Melt set up, since
              unlike Diluc or Klee, Hu Tao doesn't shatter frozen enemies.

                  Regarding Weapon Choices:

                with ideal stacking. While this is a very strong weapon when
                fully stacked, maintaining the stacks on Hu Tao isn't ideal in
                realistic situations making the weapon less consistent than
                other options.
              - b: "Deathmatch: "
              - >
                Deathmatch is better than Dragon's Bane when you're not doing
                Vaporize.
              - b: "Blackcliff Pole:"

              - >2
                 White Tassel in practice as it is difficult to maintain stacks consistently. It is not recommended to buy this weapon specifically for Hu Tao and should only be used if you already have one.
              - b: "Vortex Vanquisher and Skyward Spine: "
              - "Provides little to nothing to Hu Tao since she scales better
                with HP% than ATK% with every spear in the game. "
              - b: >-
                  Base ATK makes little difference on Hu Tao because she has a
                  very high HP to ATK conversion cap.

                  White Tassel: 
              - White Tassel requires your combos to be more focused on Normal
                Attacks (N2C over N1C) to make use of it's passive.

                Provides higher AA damage than 4CW but lowers your Elemental

                100% shield uptime when using Bolide (4). The difference is, you
                want to use 2/2 WT/CW when focusing on Nuking and better
                consistency, while 4 Bolide is for overall higher AA damage at

                cannot keep your shield permanently."

                  Regarding Artifact Substats Priority: 
              - Since Hu Tao is able to trigger Vaporize on most of her damage
                output, Elemental Mastery is quite valuable on her. If you have
                less than 100EM total (including from Sucrose EM share, 4pc
                Instructor, etc) EM substat take priority over Crit Rate / DMG.

                contributing to Physical DPS even when he's off-field.
          - p: There is an animation cancelling technique with Fischl DPS. After 3 or 5
              basic attacks, shoot an Aim Shot to reset your attack combo. The
              faster you can do this, the better it is. Only use this for
              animation cancelling when you're out of stamina since it can be
              pretty hard to replicate consistently.

              - Viridescent Hunt is a really good investment that even surpasses
                Amos in a situation where there are crowds of enemies, although
                it's not as efficient towards massive single targets or really
                agile targets. It offers crowd DPS that is severely lacking due
                to Fischl's single target attacks.

        tips: Beidou's skill grants you an Electro status for a brief moment upon
          holding it. This means it can be used for status-cleansing (No
          particular effective element). Can only be done on herself.

                effectively make use of the full stacks, as long as you have her
                stacks up before swapped away, the stacks will be maintained

                  Redhorn Stonethresher: 
              - Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you're getting, this

                 This set seeks to maximise your Burst damage in an Electro-Charged or mono Electro comps, take note that the set could be rendered useless when against enemies with non-Electro elements imbued.
              - b: "Noblesse Oblige (4): "

                This set could be considered if your Beidou can get her
                Elemental Burst off cooldown and the team doesn't have a
                Noblesse Oblige (4) user yet, do note that sometimes Beidou
                doesn't benefit from the ATK buff from the 4 piece set if she's
                the set holder, so Beidou as a Noblesse Oblige (4) holder isn't
                really recommended.
              - b: "Scholar (2) The Exile (2): "
              - This set acts as a cheap beginner's option to provide Beidou
                with 40% Energy Recharge to help maintain her Elemental Burst
                uptime.

              Overload Lisa teams, you would be building for EM DPS since you
              can be the consistent trigger with supports that apply constant
              Pyro off-field. You can still have an Overload team with an
              Electro DPS Lisa, however, if the situation prefers it.

        tips: Lisa's Hold cast does not require 4 full seconds of charging to reach
          maximum damage threshold, as long as the indicator aligns with ring,
          you can release your cast at max damage.

          Razor's EB grants you an Electro Status when you basic attack while
          burst is in-effect, that means it can be used for status-cleansing (no
          particular effective element).  Can only be done on himself.

        notes: Traveler can provide a lot of energy and Energy Recharge to the on-field
          character through their Elemental Skill pick up or Elemental Burst
          procs. This is especially useful with a damage dealer that doesn't
          conflict with traveler's element and can benefit from the abundance of
          energy. Due to the low damage scaling on Electro Traveler's Elemental
          Skill and Burst, its recommended to build Electro Traveler by just
          stacking Energy Recharge to amplify the batterying power.

                Both physical and electro keqing are good and viable. You'd usually want to decide which build to go for depending on your weapon gacha luck. For example, Lion's Roar = Electro, Flute will be equally good on Electro/Phys, etc.

                  Thundering Fury (2) +18% ATK set (2): 
              - >
                This set is a generalist set, which means it can be used
                generally anywhere, whether it be Co-op or Abyss, or other
                singleplayer content. This has a lot of consistency due to its
                independence from electro aura, and it is more viable in abyss.
              - b: "Thundersoother (4): "
              - >
                This set should be used with Electro-charged team compositions
                (Keqing + Xingqiu) or mono-electro team comp (Not Suggested).
                This set has a 35% Dmg modifier which increases all damage from
                all sources, although that modifier is a bit unstable due to its
                dependency to the sustainability of Electro aura on enemies.
              - b: "Thundering Fury (2) Noblesse Oblige (2): "
              - This set is used for Burst/Quickswap AoE Keqing. With this set,
                you'd want to be using Starward Sword (Q) all the time, which is
                your main source of DPS with this set.

        tips:
          - p: Barbara's skill gives you a pulse of healing every 5 seconds, every pulse
              will imbue you with a Hydro status, that means it can be used for
              status-cleansing (Pyro in specific, while other elements may take
              more pulses).
          - p: Take note that Hydro reacting with Cryo status will freeze you in place, her
              skill should be used in consideration of the environment
        notes:
          - p:
              - >-
                Use Charged Attacks if you're going to be doing Vaporize DPS,
                Normal Attacks are for Electro-Charge DPS.

                Always activate your skill first, as it reduces stamina consumption and if you have 
              - b: "[C2],"
              - " it will give 15% Hydro Damage Bonus."
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Weapon Choices:"
              - "\n"
              - b: "Memory of Dust: "
              - This weapon requires stacks to be utilized, and in Vaporize DPS
                comps, you usually don't want to give up the first few Vaporize
                hits to stack up Memory of Dust's perk.

                 Acts as a place holder set for Maiden Beloved if you want pure healing and have not been able to gather Maiden Beloved (4) yet.
              - b: "Noblesse Oblige (4): "
              - Usable option if you want Barbara to have more utility, but do
                note that Barbara might have bad uptime on this set.

          To make Mona's burst damage trigger the Vaporize 2.0x multiplier:

          1. Apply Pyro on enemy

          2. Cast Burst (should react and remove Pyro status on the enemy after using Burst)

          3. Wait 2.5 seconds for Mona's burst ICD (Mona should stay on field if you have Bennett, to keep the buff)

          4. Swap to Pyro character and apply Pyro on enemy

          5. Burst will pop after enemy gets hit, applying Hydro and vaporising her damage.

        tips: Diona's Elemental Skill grants you a cryo shield which allows cleansing.
          Every time you swap characters with the shield up, it applies cryo.
          This acts as a cleanse.
        notes:
          - p: The shielding Diona puts out should offset the need for healing from her
              burst. The damage boost from Noblesse Oblige (4) has more
              practical use. Additionally, her first constellation greatly
              increases her ultimate uptime, further lowering the healing
              needed.
          - p: As a support, Diona's typically used for three things; Shielding, Healing,
              and Cryo particle generation. Pairing Diona with Cryo carries such
              as Ganyu and Eula allows you to funnel energy into your DPS
              characters while providing them with quick shields for stagger
              resistance. Weapons such as Sacrificial Bow and Favonius Warbow
              greatly increase her potential as a battery.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Weapon Choices:"
              - "\n"
              - b: "Sacrificial Bow: "
              - >
                Prefered over Favonious especially at higher refinements due to
                having better Shield uptime.
              - b: "Favonius Warbow:"
              - >2
                 You will look to build some Crit Rate coverage to have a higher chance of triggering bow passive for energy.
              - b: "Recurve Bow: "
              - This bow will be your best choice for stronger shields, but it
                reduces Diona's burst uptime significantly due to no Energy
                Recharge on her weapon.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Sets:"
              - "\n"
              - b: "Noblesse Oblige (4): "
              - >
                This set provides an atk buff while also increasing burst damage
                - this set is usually used with healers because you want to use
                damage sets on other support units such as Xingqiu or Beidou.
              - b: "Emblem of Severed Fate (2) Tenacity of the Milellith (2): "
              - Provides both ER and HP which are both valuable for a support
                diona, increasing ult uptime and healing strength respectively.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Main Stat Choices:"
              - >-2
                 
                Full Stack HP% is recommended if you want stronger shields but a weaker heal. You can use Healing Bonus Circlet if you want a nice balance between the two.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Talent Priority:"
              - >-2
                 
                Prioritise whichever your Diona is geared for (shielder or healer), if built for a balance between the two, level both equally.

                Prioritize Elemental Skill on a Freeze team to furthermore extend the duration of the Cryo infusion.

          - p: Kaeya's Elemental Burst makes him an excellent source of Cryo application for
              characters that often stay in melee range, although his burst
              can't be fully utilized with Reverse Melt teams due to how his
              Cryo damage is split into a barrage of attacks.
          - p: In most teams, investment for damage is not a necessity, most notable
              examples are Razor teams and Hutao Xingqiu teams where his general
              purpose is to apply Cryo, instead of being the damage dealer. This
              does not mean that he should not be invested, but is still useful
              even without proper investments.

                 this weapon would have a lower priority as the Energy Recharge stat would mostly be wasted.

                Compared to Kaeya, Rosaria has even less desire for Crit Rate, as her Ascension 1 Talent includes an extra 12% Crit Rate once skill hits the back of an enemy.

          - p: Be sure to cast skill before burst as Crit Rate granted by the Ascension 1
              Talent will be included with Ascension 4 Talent Bonus as well.
          - p: "Rosaria's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst can be Reverse Melted (1.5x)
              with another Pyro applier for some quick and powerful damage. "
        notes:
          - p: This section is tailored around giving Rosaria as much damage as possible.
              Crit Rate stacking is not as necessary, if 50% Crit Rate is
              guaranteed at the very least, you will still be giving crit rate
              buffs of 9.7% with the Ascension 1 Talent Bonus.

                 This ranking is assumed without a shield. With a large amount of attack buffs such as Bennett, this weapon can fall off compared to the other options due to overstacking ATK%.

              - " These weapons are only used if Rosaria is played in a team
                comp in which she "

              - Although this weapon's damage is lower for Rosaria, the extra
                energy generated from the passive can be very valuable in alot

                 Only viable on Rosaria if she's triggering Reverse Melt, pulls ahead of Noblesse Oblige (2) Blizzard Strayer (2) assuming you can trigger Reverse Melt on all of her kits.

          - p:
              - b: The following is only recommended to those who have not obtained a desirable
                  set for Rosaria, with Crit Rate building as her placeholder

                If you don't wish to hyperinvest onto Rosaria, she could still be used as a Crit Rate provider, you can build up to 88% Crit Rate and use skill to cap out 100% Crit Rate, then cast Elemental Burst for the Crit Rate buff. This can be easily achievable if you have an existing Crit Rate substat polearm, otherwise just put on whatever Crit Rate Circlet, Substats and Berserker artifacts you may have to stack Crit Rate.

        tips: In some teams and situations, using Ganyu's Elemental Burst can be
          detrimental to overall damage due to stealing Pyro aura, thus reducing
          the amount of CAs melting.
        notes:
          - p: Ganyu's Level 2 Charged Shot applies two instances Cryo as they do not share
              the same ICD, which allows you to trigger Melt reaction twice for
              both damage instances. Charged Attack will be the majority of her
              damage output while neglecting her Skill/Burst damage contribution
              for most scenarios.

                Shot Bloom extends arrow flight duration and you can get 3
                stacks of Amos' passive even on point blank range.

                This weapon doesn't synergize well with Shimenawa's Reminiscence
                (4) due to its passive.
              - b: "Prototype Crescent: "
              - At higher refinement levels with good uptime on its passive, it
                can potentially be on par with Skyward Harp. However, do bear in
                mind that not all enemies have weak spots that you can headshot,
                which does affect its performance significantly.

                  Regarding Talent Priority:
              - Ganyu's Elemental Burst is low priority on a Melt Build since
                most of the times, you don't cast her burst at all so that it
                doesn't steal your Melt reaction.

        tips: Try to not overcap on Crit Rate (within the range of 25%-45% Crit Rate)
          since Ganyu's A1 passive only affects her Charged Shot and subsequent
          Blooms.
        notes:
          - p: Freeze Ganyu gives a lot of i-frames since you would be spamming Elemental
              Burst from all of your party members off cooldown. Ganyu's
              Elemental Burst can deal a ton of damage based on how grouped the
              enemies are, due to the quadratic scaling on her Elemental Burst.

              - Similar to the Melt Build, this weapon at higher refinement
                levels and good passive uptime can pull ahead of some of the 5
                star options such as Thundering Pulse and Skyward Harp. However,

        notes:
          - p: Eula's weapon rankings assume that you're running her with a Cryo battery
              (i.e. Diona) instead of Bennett. She would usually need 30%-60%+
              Energy Recharge from substats depending on what team and Cryo
              batteries you use.
          - p: Eula's Elemental Burst does not snapshot. This means that any buffs Eula has
              upon casting Burst will not be taken into effect if the buff
              duration expires before the Lightfall Sword hits.

                This weapon is more forgiving towards ER substats. If there is a

                Bloodstained Chivalry (2). If you are able to sustain the
                conditional buff, you will be able to achieve a 50% Physical DMG
                Bonus + 18% ATK. Without using your Elemental Burst, you can
                sustain the Pale Flame's 4 piece set bonus because each stack
                lasts 7s and it refreshes per stack, and Eula's Elemental Skill
                cooldown is only 4 seconds when doing 1-taps, therefore you can
                keep the condition up. When using this set, it is recommended to
                not use Hold Skill cast until your Lightfall Sword is nearly
                about to end. This restriction is only for players who don't
                have Eula "

              - b: "Pale Flame (2) Bloodstained Chivalry (2): "
              - This is a non-conditional, consistent artifact set that provides
                you a constant 50% Physical DMG bonus. While that by itself is
                amazing, Pale Flame (4) can outperform this set because it also
                has another 18% ATK buff and is easily maintained through her
                low tap skill cooldown.

          - p:
              - Aloy is much preferred as a Burst Support over Main DPS as
                getting coil stacks for her Cryo infusion can be quite
                unreliable.
              - b: " Aloy needs 4 coil stacks to get the Cryo infusion and you can only get 1
                  stack every 0.1 seconds"
              - " which is quite hard to do considering the Bomblets are
                scattered all over the place. One thing to note regarding Aloy's
                coil stacks is that "
              - b: she can still get coil stacks even when she's off-field.
          - p:
              - Aloy is very niche as she only performs well in certain comps
                and even then, she's still completely replaceable by other
                characters.
              - b: " She can be utilized on a Freeze team "
              - "where she can be a battery and nuke at the same time since she
                provides 5 Cryo particles on her Elemental Skill. "
              - b: She can also be utilized on a Melt team
              - " where you can melt her Elemental Burst for quite a decent
                amount of damage."

              - "\n"
              - b: "Polar Star: "
              - >
                Forcing to get Polar stacks isn't worth due to consuming extra
                time to get those stacks.
              - b: "The Stringless: "
              - >
                Placement was considering Aloy is used on a Reverse Melt team.
                On Reverse Melt Aloy, Stringless especially at higher refinement
                levels can pull ahead of Thundering Pulse.
              - b: "Prototype Crescent: "
              - >
                Assumes the passive is active by proccing a weak point shot.
                This weapon especially at higher refinement levels can be as
                good as a Skyward Harp.
              - b: "Sacrificial Bow: "
              - A pretty decent option to make Aloy a Cryo battery as her
                Elemental Skill provides 5 Cryo particles.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Sets:"
              - "\n"
              - b: "Blizzard Strayer (4): "
              - >
                This artifact set is best used on a Freeze-focused Aloy as it
                provides a ton of Crit Value.
              - b: "Wanderer's Troupe (2): "
              - >
                This artifact set bonus only benefits a Melt-focused Aloy,
                Elemental Mastery provides nothing on a Freeze Aloy.
              - b: "Noblesse Oblige (4): "
              - Aloy is one of the best Noblesse holders since she has low
                energy requirements and cooldown for her Elemental Burst.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Main Stat and Substats Priority: "
              - "\n"
              - b: "Elemental Mastery "
              - "is only an option if your Aloy is played on a "
              - b: Reverse Melt team

                 The passive of this weapon works perfectly with Shenhe's Elemental Skill because it's dynamic. This weapon also has high Base ATK which makes ATK% substats really effective.

                 This weapon provides Energy Recharge and converts Energy Recharge to ATK, which benefits Shenhe a lot.

                 This weapon's passive can't be stacked off-field, but it's still an ATK stat stick which provides Shenhe with a lot of ATK.

              - With this weapon, it is better to have some Crit Rate on Shenhe
                for the weapon passive to proc. (Do note that Cryo Resonance
                provides 15% Crit Rate on Cryo-imbued enemies, so the need for
                Crit Rate on Shenhe is lowered)

        tips:
          - "When utilized as a Viridescent Venerer (4) artifact set holder, "
          - b: make sure you don't immediately swap away after casting Skill/Burst,
          - " you need to be on-field when the swirl reaction happens for you to
            trigger the 4-set effect."
        notes:
          - p: People often compare Sucrose with Venti for Crowd-Control capabilities, but
              that's not what you'll be looking for. Sucrose is a character that
              can give Elemental Mastery to her teammates through swirling the
              correct elements (Ascension 1 Talent), which improves reaction
              damage for the Characters benefitting from the EM boost. Her
              Ascension 4 Talent also boosts the entire team's EM by 20% of
              Sucrose's total EM, this is why you want to stack as much
              elemental mastery as possible in her artifacts. As a support, most
              of Sucrose's value lies on her Ascension 1 and 4 talents, hence
              leveling her other talents (Normal Attack, Skill, and Burst) is
              not required.

                It's important to note that these weapons were ranked based on
                how much EM they offered you. However, this doesn't take into
                account how much each catalyst benefits your entire team's DPS.
              - b: "Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers: "
              - This weapon does not provide any EM, however it overtakes the
                other weapons on the list when it comes to enabling your team.
              - b: " It offers 48% ATK boost to the character you swap to which is equivalent to
                  1 main stat. "
              - This enables your DPS more if compared to Sacrificial Fragments
                which only gives ~44EM, equivalent to only 2 substats.

              - b: not recommended for general gameplay
              - |2
                 but only if you want the highest possible EM buff.

              - " This weapon can be useful if you"
              - b: " need Sucrose's Elemental Burst up as often as possible for grouping."
              - >-2
                 You may need to get a few crit rate substats to trigger the passive reliably.
                There are some team compositions in which Sucrose's Elemental Mastery is not a priority, such as Freeze teams or an Anemo battery for Xiao. In such situations it's better for Sucrose to use to Thrilling Tales of the Dragon Slayers.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Energy Recharge Priority:"
              - >-2
                 
                Ranking is based on the assumption that Sucrose has Sacrificial Fragments and is not valued for her Burst in teams that may not want Sucrose's Burst interfering with elemental auras. Energy Recharge could be prioritized higher when Sucrose is utilized in teams that don't really mind which element is being applied first and last (e.g. Electro-charged).

                This section is dedicated to utilising the Anemo Traveler's
                Elemental Skill / Burst. Due to how little field time this
                playstyle takes, the Traveler can also fulfill the role of a
                quickswap style Sub-DPS.

                Anemo Traveler can require 
              - b: up to 160% Energy Recharge.

                Elemental Skill reset, however doing so will require you to "

              - This weapon can lower your ER% requirements from anywhere
                between ~150% to no additional ER% needed, depending on the
                number of stacks on the passive and the refinement of this
                weapon. As such, at higher refines / more stacks on the passive,
                this weapon can perform better than Skyward Blade, while at
                lower refines / less stacks, it can perform worse.

                The ranking here only assumes Jean's personal damage and not the
                utility it gives. If you want to furthermore buff your main DPS,
                you can give this sword to Jean as she can trigger
                Freedom-Sworn's skill relatively easily since Anemo is always
                trigger.

              - b: "Ocean-Hued Clam (4): "
              - The best set for Jean's personal damage, as the damage it deals
                scales with Jean's burst healing. However, because Jean's total
                damage output is on the low end, it is generally recommended to
                prioritize utility options such as Noblesse Oblige or
                Viridescent Venerer over this set.

                If you prefer more damage than healing, prioritize Elemental
                Skill over Elemental Burst since it scales better.

                For Support Jean, you can either go for more ATK for stronger heals, but relatively lower Burst uptime, or more ER for lower heals, but higher Burst uptime. Choosing between these two is up to personal preference, although if another Anemo character is on the team, Jean has very little energy problem and can potentially go full Sub DPS build.

          - p: You can infuse elements onto Venti's Burst if you walk up with an element
              status on you. (e.g. Bennett Burst > Venti Burst > Walk up to
              infuse Pyro)

          - p: This build focuses on damage over ER because of his ER ascension stat. This
              weapon order is in the assumption of EM Venti, as Crit Venti's

                 Due to EM build assumptions, the stats offered aren't very valuable. Consider reading the In-depth Guide from KQM if you're interested in a Crit-focused build.

              - " Elegy for the End's ATK buff DOES NOT buff Venti's burst if
                Venti is the one equipping the bow, but the EM buff affects
                Venti's Swirl reaction. This is due to Venti's burst
                snapshotting his stats (excluding EM toward transformative
                reactions such as Swirl) at the time of cast. While an "

          notes: It is worth noting that set bonuses do not increase Xiao's damage by
            much, due to an oversaturation on DMG% bonuses and ATK% from various
            sources. For this reason, it is better to opt out for artifact
            pieces which have higher quality substats instead of trying to
            maintain a set bonus.

        notes:
          - p:
              - "Xiao has issues with Energy regeneration because "
              - b: he cannot generate any particles with his Elemental Skill while his Burst is
                  active,
              - " so it is not suggested to use his Elemental Skill during
                Elemental Burst."
          - p: Start off a fight by casting the skill of your Anemo Battery and then casting
              his skill twice then cast your burst immediately. You will want to
              be half way through your burst animation before the particles
              reach you, so this way you can start off your burst with a portion
              of the energy gauge already filled. Same goes for any other Anemo
              Battery (recommended below), cast skill and swap back to Xiao to
              cast burst before the particles reach you.
          - p:
              - b: "You'll want to pair Xiao with another Anemo character "
              - (Venti, Sucrose, Jean or Anemo Traveler) to help him gain energy
                while his Elemental Burst is on cooldown. Xiao's Elemental Burst
                ends when you swap to another character. Although he has two
                charges of his Elemental Skill, only ONE charge comes back per
                cooldown.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Weapon Choices:"
              - >2
                 With a proper anemo battery (e.g. Sucrose), Xiao needs as little as 120-130% ER to maintain a high burst uptime. In these scenarios, unless there are no ER from substats, you should always go for a non-ER weapon as it will result in more damage.
              - b: "Calamity Queller: "
              - This weapon has a really high Base ATK, which means you benefit
                more from ATK% buffs (e.g. Thrilling Tales of the Dragon
                Slayers) if compared with other weapons.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Sets: "
              - Prioritize Viridescent Venerer over the other 2 +18% ATK sets if
                there are external ATK% buff sources on your team.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Main Stats: "
              - Anemo DMG% goblets are recommended for Xiao. ATK% goblets serve
                as a good alternative for him.

              Mastery in order to maximise his utility.
          - p:
              b: Similar to Venti, due to the EM buffs, a triple EM build will out-damage a
                regular ATK-EM/Anemo/Crit build as long as there are 2+ enemies
                due to the amount of swirls involved. Because of this, an ADC
                (Attack/Damage/Crit) build isn't recommended unless he is in a
                team whereby he cannot make use of his A4 passive or swirls.

                 Having Sacrificial Sword or a second Anemo character in the team will also help reduce the needs for ER and prioritize EM substats more.

        tips: Ningguang's Elemental Skill has a 6 second internal cooldown on generating
          energy, so for the sake of maintaining Elemental Burst uptime, wait 6
          seconds to cast again if you need energy. It also breaks when casted
          on top of another Geo Structure, you can intentionally use a structure
          to break your first screen.
        notes:
          - p: Due to Ningguang having a really low Base ATK and no ATK conversion
              mechanics, external ATK buffers such as Bennett is recommended as
              a support for Ningguang to bump up her ATK stat.

                A really good weapon with external ATK buffs considered due to

          - p: A Burst Support Ningguang is basically a quickswap DPS Ningguang, you don't
              do Normal Attacks & Charged Attacks as much, so your main source

                 Falls off a bit if compared to Skyward Atlas due to not being able to stack the passive reliably, but it's still a Crit weapon which makes stat building much easier.

                A really good ATK statstick which can perform better than the
                other options if you don't consider external ATK buffers like
                Bennett, Pyro resonance, etc, but falls off with it considered.
              - b: "Solar Pearl:"
              - " Due to Solar Pearl's passive being able to buff quite a huge
                percentage of a quickswap Ningguang's damage (Elemental Burst

          - extends the duration of Gorou's Elemental Burst from 9 seconds to 12
            seconds if you can obtain the required Crystallize shields. This
            allows his teammates to gain the 3 Geo 15% Geo DMG% bonus for a
            longer duration, so it's preferable to use Burst as your last
            ability before swapping into your DPS.
        notes:
          - p:
              - "Gorou is a Support character that can give increasing buffs to
                your party members from his Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst
                based on the number of Geo characters in your team (capped at
                3). Casting his Elemental Skill sets up a banner which gives
                flat DEF (1 Geo), Interruption Resistance (2 Geo) and Geo DMG%
                Bonus (3 Geo) for your active character standing inside the
                banner radius. Casting his Elemental Burst creates a field
                following the active character which deals periodic damage and
                offers the same bonuses given by the Skill, destroying any
                placed banners in the process, it also pulls in nearby Elemental
                Shards created by Crystallize reactions. Due to his kit focusing
                on buffing DEF and Geo DMG, he's a specialised support geared
                towards Geo DPS that scales with DEF, such as Noelle or Itto. He
                can see niche use at "

                choice for future Geo DPS characters, or in a team which

                Casting Elemental Burst regenerates a total of 6 Energy for each

                by a bit for all of your party members, which can be quite
                beneficial. Do note that this is a 4 star set so you're
                potentially missing out on 5 star stat scaling, which is a 34%
                difference in mainstat value and 25% difference in individual
                substat value.
              - b: "Noblesse Oblige (4): "
              - The effectiveness of this set increases if you've already met
                the ER requirement for Gorou. At that point, you'd no longer

              - >2
                 can be considered when Gorou is using Favonius Warbow to trigger the passive comfortably.
              - b: ER% substats can usually be more important than getting the right mainstat,
              - " as Gorou's damage contribution to a team is negligible, while
                being able to get Energy for his Burst is a lot more important."

          Skill and Burst have equal priorities.

          When using your Elemental Skill, try to use the hold variant of it over tapping, as it has a slight delay on the tap variant.

                every rotation, and also gives the player a very little time

              - b: "This kind of playstyle is very straightforward; stack as much HP as
                  possible. Prioritize HP scaling polearms such as Black Tassel

                  capitalize on Zhongli's Shield. "
              - Most of the time, especially on a HP-focused Zhongli, casting
                Elemental Burst is a DPS loss due to the cast time, which is why
                you'd only want to cast Elemental Burst for the Crowd Control it
                offers, and not for damage.
          - p: Note that if paired with Xingqiu and/or Beidou, the damage reduction from
              orbitals from Xingqiu's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst and/or
              Beidou's Elemental Burst can be utilized on Zhongli's shield,
              making it basically unbreakable.

          - p: Zhongli can be utilized as a Geo Burst damage dealer due to his short
              Elemental Burst cooldown (12s) and low energy cost (40 Energy).
              His Elemental Skill Hold Cast (Shield) scales with HP and at
              Ascension 4, you would unlock a talent that allows your Elemental
              Burst to scale with 33% of Zhongli's Max HP, making him a great
              source of Shield and damage.
          - p:
              - b: |
                  Regarding Artifact Main Stats:
              - ATK sands provides more damage than HP sands, but it does have
                lesser Shield HP. If you want more Shield HP, you can consider
                running a HP sands.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Sets:"
              - "\n"
              - b: "Noblesse Oblige (2) Archaic Petra (2): "
              - >
                On lower ER requirements where Zhongli doesn't need to worry
                about his energy needs, this set pulls ahead of Emblem of
                Severed Fate (4).
              - b: "Noblesse Oblige (4):"
              - >2
                 This set provides Zhongli more utility when casting his Elemental Burst, you can use this set on Zhongli if there is nobody else on the team who's equipping this set.
              - b: "Tenacity of the Millelith (4): "
              - Just like Noblesse Oblige (4), this set provides Zhongli with
                more utility if his Elemental Skill hits an enemy. This set also
                provides Zhongli with stronger shields.

        tips: Albedo's Elemental Skill particle generation is completely RNG like
          Zhongli, but with better odds.
        notes:
          - p: Albedo is a character that can summon a Geo Construct from his Elemental
              Skill which deals damage on a 2 second interval whenever enemies
              in the field are damaged. His Elemental Burst provides 125 EM to
              the party, which is good on teams that rely on amplification
              reactions, such as Vaporize. It is worth noting that since his
              stat priority is focused on DEF (Elemental Skill scaling), you
              might want to skip casting Elemental Burst if your team doesn't
              benefit from the 125 EM buff. Another option is to build him with
              ATK-DEF Hybrid, which ends up with lower Skill damage but higher
              Burst damage.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Weapon Choices:"
              - "\n"
              - b: "Primordial Jade Cutter:"
              - >2
                 On a Hybrid build where Albedo casts his Elemental Burst, this weapon can be a better option than Cinnabar Spindle on certain situations, such as AoE where Albedo's Burst hits multiple enemies or when there are external ATK buffs like Bennett's Burst. On a pure Elemental Skill focused Albedo or Single Target situations for Hybrid Albedo, Cinnabar Spindle is the better option, so choose wisely.
              - b: "Harbinger of Dawn:"
              - >2
                 Albedo's Elemental Skill scales with Defense, which is why the Base ATK from the weapon doesn't matter that much. Harbinger of Dawn offers a lot of Crit stats which is why it is one of the strongest weapons for him despite being a 3 star weapon. The downside of this weapon is that you'd need to keep Albedo's HP at 90% or higher to benefit from the passive, so it might be annoying to use against certain enemies which has a HP lowering debuff, even when off-field, such as Corrosion.
              - b: "Mistsplitter Reforged:"
              - >2
                 Realistically you are only able to get 2 stacks of this weapon's passive and this requires setup. Generally just use Harbinger of Dawn instead and give your Mistsplitter Reforged to another sword DPS character.
              - b: "Freedom-Sworn:"
              - " Equipping this weapon will decrease Albedo's own damage
                significantly but he is one of the better Freedom-Sworn holders
                since he can trigger the passive quite easily to buff your other
                party members."
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Sets:"
              - "\n"
              - b: "Husk of Opulent Dreams (4):"
              - >2
                 Due to Albedo's skill snapshotting upon cast, you need to either wait ~12 seconds before starting a domain/fight to reach max stacks or recast his skill to benefit from the DEF and Geo DMG bonus provided by the 4 piece set effect.
              - b: "Tenacity of the Milelith (4):"
              - >2
                 This set is used for the 4 piece set effect which has good uptime on Albedo. Worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.
              - b: "Noblesse Oblige (4):"
              - " If you don't have another character in your party that has
                this set, you can use this set on Albedo. You might want to get
                some Energy Recharge substats to maintain your Elemental Burst
                uptime for this. It is also worth noting that this set decreases
                your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other
                offensive sets."
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Substats Priority:"
              - >-
                
                ATK and Energy Recharge substats are only valuable on a Hybrid Albedo that casts his Elemental Burst.

        notes:
          - p: Arataki Itto is a Geo DPS Character who takes advantage of his Elemental
              Burst's ATK boost and Geo infusion to deal significant damage
              during its uptime. His combos involve stacking and unleashing his
              Charged Attacks, named Arataki Kesagiri. Arataki Kesigiri consumes
              no stamina and can be casted continuously as long as he has
              Superlative Superstrength stacks. Superlative Superstrength is
              capped at 5 stacks at any given time, and Itto gets those stacks
              when his 2nd and 4th Normal Attack string hits an enemy.
              Activating his Elemental Burst allows his 1st and 3rd Normal
              Attack to also generate stacks. Itto's Elemental Skill deals
              damage to enemies on cast and summons a taunt, Ushi, which is
              considered a Geo Construct. This initial cast damage grants Itto 1
              Superlative Superstrength stack, and upon Ushi leaving the field,
              Itto is granted another stack. When Ushi takes damage, Itto gains
              a stack (capped at 1 stack per 2 seconds). Itto's Elemental Burst
              converts his Normal and Charged Attacks into Geo DMG, increases
              Itto's Normal Attack Speed and converts a portion of Itto's
              current DEF to ATK.

              - >2
                 When using Husk of Opulent Dreams, Serpent Spine stacks are prioritized over Husk of the Opulent Dreams stacks due to their conflicting nature in gaining stacks (Off-field and on-field).
              - b: "Skyward Pride: "

                Can be a great or bad weapon for Itto depending on your ER
                needs. The less Energy Recharge you need (due to particle
                generation from your party members or ER from subs), the less
                useful this weapon becomes.
              - b: "Whiteblind:"
              - " Your rotations often start with 1 stack of this weapon, and
                due to Itto's Burst snapshotting DEF on cast, you're unable to
