        tips:
          - p: Bennett's EB grants you a pyro status as long as your characters are within
              his burst AoE (Cryo in specific, since Pyro > Cryo).
          - p: For that, cast EB with Bennett, switch to the character imbued with Cryo and
              walk on Bennett's Burst field
          - p: >
              Upon entering burst field, the Pyro status will continuously imbue
              you with Pyro, reacting with other elements on you and eventually
              removing them.

                Pyro Damage Bonus will always be the best for cup. The combo for the highest Melt/Vaporize damage is

              - b: It's worth noting that the main-stat artifacts you want to farm for 4-TF
                  Bennett varies from the main-stat artifacts you'd normally go
                  for in other builds. Instead of ATK/EM, Pyro, and Crit, you'd
                  instead want to go for EM/Pyro/EM on a 4-TF Bennett.
              - " As such, this also means weapons that have EM substats such as
                "
              - b: Iron Sting
              - " take priority over other swords."
          - p:
              - "It is also worth noting that with 4 TF, "

              - b: MIstsplitter Reforged
              - >-2
                 due to its massive Crit Rate% substat, which allows you to vape consistently despite the lack of Crit Dmg/Crit Rate subs in your artifacts. This assumes that your EM mainstat pieces (sands, goblet, and circlet) lack Crit Rate substats. However, in the rare occasion that your EM pieces manage to roll plenty of Crit subs, Mistsplitter easily overtakes Jade Cutter.
                Recommended amount of ER%: 130-150%. Worth noting that 
              - b: with Thundering Fury (4), you have a lot more leeway when it comes to ER.

                  Regarding Weapon Choices:
                  Mistsplitter Reforged, Aquila Favonia:
              - >2
                 These weapons have the highest Base ATK in the game which is why it is ranked quite high. It is assuming you have enough Energy Recharge so you still can burst off cooldown for the maximum ATK buff.
              - b: "Freedom-Sworn:"
              - >2
                 In comps where Bennett can reliably trigger reactions (and thus trigger this sword's passive), the buffs provided by this weapon will be stronger than Aquila Favonia.
              - b: "The Alley Flash: "
              - >
                This weapon currently has the highest Base ATK for a 4 star
                weapon (even more Base ATK than some 5 stars like Skyward
                Blade).
              - b: "Prototype Rancour: "
              - This weapon has one of the highest Base ATK for a 4 Star weapon
                (and this is also a weapon you could craft from the Blacksmith)

        tips:
          - p: Xinyan's ES grants you a pyro status upon contact with shield. No matter how
              many times you switch your characters, it'll still apply pyro
              every instant you switch with shield. This allows you to cleanse
              every single elemental status that has been applied to you.
          - p: If the status doesn't get cleansed, switch on that character one more time
              with the shield. Pyro doesn't cleanse Hydro very efficiently, take
              Cecilia Garden for example, you'll have to apply pyro on your
              character 4 times before actually cleansing the hydro status.

        tips: >
          Yanfei's Ascension 4 Talent does a second hit after a Crit Charge
          Attack. This scales 80% of your ATK and can trigger reactions as well
          due to having a separate internal cooldown on its pyro application. 
        notes:
          - p: Yanfei can have trouble trying to set up for her reaction DPS. Vaporize is
              generally the more consistent option and you need Xingqiu to make
              this work best. When running a Vaporize team with Xingqiu, 3
              normal attacks into a charged attack (N1>N2>N3>C) is the safest
              and most reliable way to vaporize your charged attacks. Make sure
              you're applying hydro first before starting combos.

                  Regarding Artifact Substats Priority: 
              - Energy Recharge is prioritized over Elemental Mastery here since
                she has an 80 energy burst cost while her skill is also not very
                efficient at generating particles for getting it back. A major
                source of your energy will be coming from enemies as well as
                potential pyro batteries like Bennett, so be sure to have her
                pick the particles up as off-field characters only get 0.6x the
                value of the particles.

                  Regarding Weapon Choices:

                  These placements assume strong ATK buffs such as Bennett, as Diluc is commonly played with them present in his party.

                This weapon falls off considerably when strong ATK buffs are not
                present, still being a top tier option but similar in power to
                the weapons ranked directly below.
              - b: "Serpent Spine: "
              - "This placement assumes you can "
              - b: maintain high stacks of the weapon effect.

                 will find itself falling significantly in potential. This weapon scales well with refinements, having the potential to be Diluc's best weapon.

                Generally the best go to set for Diluc due to how easily Diluc
                can stack the Pyro Damage effect, while his burst imbues his
                Normal/Charged Attacks with Pyro.
              - b: "Gladiator's Finale (4): "
              - " For those who are still reluctant on farming for Crimson Witch
                of Flames (Pre-AR 45), this will still provide a fairly decent
                increase in DPS as a large portion of his damage is tied into
                his Normal Attack talent."
          - p:
              - b: |
                  Regarding Main Stats Priority:
              - If Diluc is run alongside Xingqiu where he can trigger Vaporize
                very often, he can run EM sands as an alternative to ATK sands
                as EM boosts Diluc's reaction damage significantly.

              damage with her talents faster than normal. "
          - p: Her N1 can be canceled through holding a directional key while clicking
              attack. This can be chained over and over again to produce a
              "machine gun" effect.
          - p: Her optimal combos include N1C and N2C. N1C is higher DPS but eats stamina
              faster, while N2C has more consistency in keeping enemies stunned
              and gives a higher chance of obtaining her A1 passive onto the
              following CA.
        notes:

                other builds mentioned above.

        notes:
          - p: Hu Tao is most effective when used with Xingqiu to proc Vaporize/Freeze Melt
              reactions which utilizes her BiS Set, Crimson Witch of Flames (4).
              Freeze Melt refers to freezing enemies for Melt set up, since
              unlike Diluc or Klee, Hu Tao doesn't shatter frozen enemies.

                  Regarding Weapon Choices:
                  Primordial Jade Winged-Spear: 
              - "Is better than the "
              - b: "[R1] "
              - "variants of "

              - b: "Deathmatch "
              - >
                with ideal stacking. While this is a very strong weapon when
                fully stacked, maintaining the stacks on Hu Tao isn't ideal in
                realistic situations making the weapon less consistent than
                other options.
              - b: "Deathmatch: "
              - >
                Deathmatch is better than Dragon's Bane when you're not doing
                Vaporize.
              - b: "Blackcliff Pole:"
              - " Despite seeming quite good due to the Crit DMG substat,
                Blackcliff at 1 stack performs only slightly better than an "
              - b: "[R5]"
              - >2
                 White Tassel in practice as it is difficult to maintain stacks consistently. It is not recommended to buy this weapon specifically for Hu Tao and should only be used if you already have one.
              - b: "Vortex Vanquisher and Skyward Spine: "
              - "Provides little to nothing to Hu Tao since she scales better
                with HP% than ATK% with every spear in the game. "
              - b: >-
                  Base ATK makes little difference on Hu Tao because she has a
                  very high HP to ATK conversion cap.

                  White Tassel: 
              - White Tassel requires your combos to be more focused on Normal
                Attacks (N2C over N1C) to make use of it's passive.

                  Regarding Artifact Sets:

                Provides higher AA damage than 4CW but lowers your Elemental
                Burst damage which hurts your AoE damage, also if you're unable
                to burst, it might cause survivability issues if you're not
                running a healer.

                the sets have an equal overall damage output assuming you have
                100% shield uptime when using Bolide (4). The difference is, you
                want to use 2/2 WT/CW when focusing on Nuking and better
                consistency, while 4 Bolide is for overall higher AA damage at
                the expense of lower burst damage, although inconsistent if you
                cannot keep your shield permanently."
          - p:
              - b: |
                  Regarding Artifact Substats Priority: 
              - Since Hu Tao is able to trigger Vaporize on most of her damage
                output, Elemental Mastery is quite valuable on her. If you have
                less than 100EM total (including from Sucrose EM share, 4pc
                Instructor, etc) EM substat take priority over Crit Rate / DMG.

              basic attacks, shoot an Aim Shot to reset your attack combo. The

          - p: Elemental Burst and Skill both summon Oz, so make sure you're only using one
              at a time. Start with your Skill, use Burst for second Oz rotation
              and alternate. Hopefully, by the time your second/third round of
              Oz summoning is over, you'll have gained enough energy to repeat
              the loop.

        tips: Beidou's skill grants you an Electro status for a brief moment upon
          holding it. This means it can be used for status-cleansing (No
          particular effective element). Can only be done on herself.

              - "\n"
              - b: "Serpent Spine: "
              - Serpent Spine is a fine choice for sub-DPS Beidou and can
                outperform Wolf's Gravestone by a significant margin when
                Bennett/Sara ATK buffs are applied.
              - b: >-2
                   Be sure to use Beidou in slot 1 to pre-stack Serpent Spine before starting a abyss floor.
                  Redhorn Stonethresher: 
              - Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you're getting, this
                weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in personal damage.

                 do note that sometimes Beidou doesn't benefit from the ATK buff from the 4 piece set if she's the set holder, so Beidou as a Noblesse Oblige (4) holder isn't really recommended.
              - b: "Scholar (2) The Exile (2): "
              - This set acts as a cheap beginner's option to provide Beidou
                with 40% Energy Recharge to help maintain her Elemental Burst
                uptime.

          - p: EM Lisa DPS aims to be the consistent trigger for reactions, Overload and
              Hyperbloom are generally the best reactions for this set up. Avoid
              having a second Electro in the Overload team for this build since
              this could mess up the Pyro aura Lisa wants for this playstyle.
          - p: Electro-Charge teams will have a hard time trying to utilize EM DPS Lisa, in
              these situations, build Electro DPS or Off-Field DPS Lisa instead.

          maximum damage threshold, as long as the indicator aligns with ring,
          you can release your cast at max damage.

          burst is in-effect, that means it can be used for status-cleansing (no

          - p: For her Elemental Skill to generate particles, you need to perform a Charged
              Shot to place a Crowfeather after casting her Elemental Skill. If
              the Crowfeather explosion hits an enemy, it generates 3 particles.

              - "Sara is a quickswap support who is able to buff your active
                characters via its Crowfeather mechanics. When Sara uses her
                Elemental Skill, her next Charged Shot will leave a Crowfeather
                on the target location and after a short while, the Crowfeather
                explodes and "
              - b: the active character in its AoE will benefit from Sara's ATK buff, which
                  scales with her Base ATK.

                Crowfeather, and save it for later on if you wanna swap back to
                her to extend her buffs. You can also use Elemental Skill
                followed by Elemental Burst so that she benefits from the
                Crowfeather dropped by her Elemental Skill, then swap to other
                character so that character can benefit from Sara's ATK buff.

                The cooldown on this weapon's passive aligns perfectly with
                Sara's Elemental Burst cooldown. This weapon has lower base ATK
                if compared with Skyward Harp, but this weapon can be considered
                over Skyward Harp since Sara is able to trigger the weapon
                passive quite easily with her Elemental Burst to provide your
                party members with another 100 EM and 20% ATK buff for 12
                seconds, it also has Energy Recharge substat which is very
                valuable on a Burst Support Sara.
              - b: "Sacrificial Bow:"
              - " The combination of high base atk and a energy recharge substat
                makes this one of her best (4✩) weapon options in teams where
                she needs a energy recharge weapon to meet energy requirements
                and battery another electro unit at the same time."

                  Regarding Artifact Sets:
                  Noblesse Oblige (4): 
              - Universal support set that is able to buff your party member's
                ATK by 20%, use this set on Sara if there's nobody else in the

        tips: It is not recommended to level Elemental Skill and Burst past talent level
          7 as the amount of energy generated does not increase.
        notes: Traveler can provide a lot of energy and Energy Recharge to the on-field
          character through their Elemental Skill pick up or Elemental Burst
          procs. This is especially useful with a damage dealer that doesn't
          conflict with traveler's element and can benefit from the abundance of
          energy. Due to the low damage scaling on Electro Traveler's Elemental
          Skill and Burst, its recommended to build Electro Traveler by just
          stacking Energy Recharge to amplify the batterying power.

              attacks with electro, and instead focuses on physical damage
              (white numbers). For this reason, you should be charged attacking
              after casting Stellar Restoration (E) instead of recasting it.

        tips: >-
          To make Mona's burst damage trigger the Vaporize 2.0x multiplier:

          1. Apply Pyro on enemy

          2. Cast Burst (should react and remove Pyro status on the enemy after using Burst)

          3. Wait 2.5 seconds for Mona's burst ICD (Mona should stay on field if you have Bennett, to keep the buff)

          4. Swap to Pyro character and apply Pyro on enemy

          5. Burst will pop after enemy gets hit, applying Hydro and vaporising her damage.

        tips:
          - p: Mona's Burst applies bubble and Omen debuff upon cast, the count down timer
              only begins when the bubble is broken.
          - p: Frozen enemies can have their bubbles preserved as long as enemies stay in a
              frozen state. This technique makes Mona a priority Support for
              Freeze DPS teams.

        tips:
          - p: Try to activate Ayato's Elemental Burst before using his skill to maximize
              his Normal Attack DMG. Getting enough Energy Recharge for this is
              important, and varies based on team. Since the casting time is so
              long, it may not be worth snapshotting into buffs.
          - p: The amount of slashes Ayato can do during an Elemental Skill window is
              sometimes influenced by the player's set FPS.
        notes:
          - p: DPS Ayato focuses on doing large amounts of on-field damage with his
              Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst.

        tips: Diona's Elemental Skill grants you a cryo shield which allows cleansing.
          Every time you swap characters with the shield up, it applies cryo.
          This acts as a cleanse.
        notes:
          - p: The shielding Diona puts out should offset the need for healing from her
              burst. The damage boost from Noblesse Oblige (4) has more
              practical use. Additionally, her first constellation greatly
              increases her ultimate uptime, further lowering the healing
              needed.
          - p: As a support, Diona's typically used for three things; Shielding, Healing,
              and Cryo particle generation. Pairing Diona with Cryo carries such
              as Ganyu and Eula allows you to funnel energy into your DPS
              characters while providing them with quick shields for stagger
              resistance. Weapons such as Sacrificial Bow and Favonius Warbow
              greatly increase her potential as a battery.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Weapon Choices:"
              - "\n"
              - b: "Sacrificial Bow: "
              - >
                Prefered over Favonius at higher refinements for consistency and
                when batterying another cryo unit.
              - b: "Favonius Warbow:"
              - " It is "
              - b: recommended to
              - >2
                 build some Crit Rate coverage to have a higher chance of triggering bow passive for energy.
              - b: "Recurve Bow: "
              - This bow will be your best choice for stronger shields, but it
                reduces Diona's burst uptime significantly due to having no
                Energy Recharge on her weapon.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Sets:"
              - "\n"
              - b: "Noblesse Oblige (4): "
              - >
                This set provides an atk buff while also increasing burst damage
                - this set is usually used with healers because you want to use
                damage sets on other support units such as Xingqiu or Beidou.
              - b: "Emblem of Severed Fate (2) Tenacity of the Milellith (2): "
              - Provides both ER and HP which are both valuable for a support
                diona, increasing ult uptime and healing strength respectively.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Main Stats Priority:"
              - >-2
                 
                Full Stack HP% is recommended if you want stronger shields but a weaker heal. You can use Healing Bonus Circlet if you want a nice balance between the two.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Talent Priority:"
              - >-2
                 
                Prioritise whichever your Diona is geared for (shielder or healer), if built for a balance between the two, level both equally.

        tips: Chongyun's Elemental Burst is calculated as Claymore damage, which means
          it breaks Geo Structures/ Shields at a much easier rate and can proc

                Prioritize Elemental Skill on a Freeze team to furthermore extend the duration of the Cryo infusion.

          - p: Kaeya's Elemental Burst makes him an excellent source of Cryo application for
              characters that often stay in melee range, although his burst
              can't be fully utilized with Reverse Melt teams due to how his
              Cryo damage is split into a barrage of attacks.
          - p: In most teams, investment for damage is not a necessity, most notable
              examples are Razor teams and Hutao Xingqiu teams where his general
              purpose is to apply Cryo, instead of being the damage dealer. This
              does not mean that he should not be invested, but is still useful
              even without proper investments.

                 this weapon would have a lower priority as the Energy Recharge stat would mostly be wasted.

          - p: Be sure to cast skill before burst as Crit Rate granted by the Ascension 1
              Talent will be included with Ascension 4 Talent Bonus as well.
          - p: "Rosaria's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst can be Reverse Melted (1.5x)
              with another Pyro applier for some quick and powerful damage. "
        notes:
          - p: This section is tailored around giving Rosaria as much damage as possible.
              Crit Rate stacking is not as necessary, if 50% Crit Rate is
              guaranteed at the very least, you will still be giving crit rate
              buffs of 9.7% with the Ascension 1 Talent Bonus.

              - >2
                 This ranking is assumed without a shield. With a large amount of attack buffs such as Bennett, this weapon can fall off compared to the other options due to overstacking ATK%.
              - b: "Dragon's Bane / Kitain Cross Spear / Missive Windspear:"
              - " These weapons are only used if Rosaria is played in a team

              - b: "Favonius Lance: "
              - Although this weapon's damage is lower for Rosaria, the extra
                energy generated from the passive can be very valuable in a lot
                of teams that need a Cryo battery (Eula, Ayaka, etc).

                 Only viable on Rosaria if she's triggering Reverse Melt, pulls ahead of Noblesse Oblige (2) Blizzard Strayer (2) assuming you can trigger Reverse Melt on all of her kits.

                Elemental Mastery is only recommended if Rosaria is to be utilized as a Reverse Melt trigger, as shown in the Ability Tips section.
          - p:
              - b: The following is only recommended to those who have not obtained a desirable
                  set for Rosaria, with Crit Rate building as her placeholder
                  set.
              - >-
                
                If you don't wish to hyperinvest onto Rosaria, she could still be used as a Crit Rate provider, you can build up to 88% Crit Rate and use skill to cap out 100% Crit Rate, then cast Elemental Burst for the Crit Rate buff. This can be easily achievable if you have an existing Crit Rate substat polearm, otherwise just put on whatever Crit Rate Circlet, Substats and Berserker artifacts you may have to stack Crit Rate.

        tips: In some teams and situations, using Ganyu's Elemental Burst can be
          detrimental to overall damage due to stealing Pyro aura, thus reducing
          the amount of CAs melting.
        notes:
          - p: Ganyu's Level 2 Charged Shot applies two instances Cryo as they do not share
              the same ICD, which allows you to trigger Melt reaction twice for
              both damage instances. Charged Attack will be the majority of her
              damage output while neglecting her Skill/Burst damage contribution
              for most scenarios.

                  Regarding Weapon Choices:
                  Amos' Bow: 
              - >
                Amos is an excellent weapon for Ganyu since her Level 2 Charge
                Shot Bloom extends arrow flight duration and you can get 3
                stacks of Amos' passive even on point blank range.
              - b: "Hamayumi: "
              - "Due to its passive, this weapon prefers "

              - b: "Prototype Crescent: "
              - At higher refinement levels with good uptime on its passive, it
                can potentially be on par with Skyward Harp. However, do bear in
                mind that not all enemies have weak spots that you can headshot,
                which does affect its performance significantly.

                  Regarding Talent Priority:
              - Ganyu's Elemental Burst is low priority on a Melt Build since
                most of the times, you don't cast her burst at all so that it
                doesn't steal your Melt reaction.

        tips: Try to not overcap on Crit Rate (within the range of 25%-45% Crit Rate)
          since Ganyu's A1 passive only affects her Charged Shot and subsequent
          Blooms.
        notes:
          - p: Freeze Ganyu gives a lot of i-frames since you would be spamming Elemental
              Burst from all of your party members off cooldown. Ganyu's
              Elemental Burst can deal a ton of damage based on how grouped the
              enemies are, due to the quadratic scaling on her Elemental Burst.

                Due to the sheer amount of Crit stats you can get from Blizzard
                Strayer (4), Ganyu's ascension passive and this weapon itself,

                 In quickswap heavy rotations (Ganyu Mona Venti Diona) where you usually don't do a lot of Charged Shots, this weapon performs worse than the other 5 star options listed.
              - b: "Prototype Crescent: "
              - Similar to the Melt Build, this weapon at higher refinement
                levels and good passive uptime can pull ahead of some of the 5
                star options such as Thundering Pulse and Skyward Harp. However,

              and keep enemies inside the zone for constant damage.
          - p: Make sure to hit enemies with her skill's initial damage and her explosion
              damage as they both regen energy for her ult.

          - p: An Off-field DPS Ganyu shines brightly on a Freeze comp as she has 100%
              Elemental Burst uptime and her Elemental Burst buffs party

              batteries you use.
          - p: Eula's Elemental Burst does not snapshot. This means that any buffs Eula has
              upon casting Burst will not be taken into effect if the buff

                own damage if team provides enough ATK% buffs, but Wolf's
                Gravestone can make up the damage difference by buffing team

                Kaeya with Favonius Sword) or if your team generates enough

                conditional buff, you will be able to achieve a 50% Physical DMG
                Bonus + 18% ATK. Without using your Elemental Burst, you can
                sustain the Pale Flame's 4 piece set bonus because each stack
                lasts 7s and it refreshes per stack, and Eula's Elemental Skill
                cooldown is only 4 seconds when doing 1-taps, therefore you can
                keep the condition up. When using this set, it is recommended to

                has another 18% ATK buff and is easily maintained through her
                low tap skill cooldown.

            if you're not using that artifact set, then it has the same priority

        tips:
          - p: Ayaka's Charged Attack, Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst is able to hit
              enemies inside sucked inside Venti's Elemental Burst.
          - p: Her Elemental Burst also stays in place on frozen enemies and slightly knocks
              enemies away when they're not frozen.
        notes:
          - p:
              - "Kamisato Ayaka is a pretty straightforward DPS that "
              - b: deals most of her damage from her Elemental Burst.
              - " She has very high scalings on her burst at the cost of it
                being 80 energy. You will likely need"
              - b: " another Cryo battery on the team "
              - "to provide energy for her (Diona, Kaeya, Rosaria, etc). She has
                a "
              - b: special dash
              - " (like Mona) and after she dashes, she will get a Cryo infusion
                on her Normal Attacks. Ensure you always have this bonus active
                to maximise your rotation damage."
          - p:
              - b: |
                  Regarding Main Stats Priority:
              - Circlet main stat will be dependant on your overall stats,
                depending on your overall stats, one can be better than the
                other. Since Ayaka is able to get a lot of Crit Value from
                Blizzard Strayer (4) set, ascension passive, and also possibly
                weapons, ATK circlets can be competitive to Crit ones, it also
                has a better drop rate, so don't throw away your good ATK
                circlets.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Weapon Choices:"
              - "\n"
              - b: "Primordial Jade Cutter:"
              - >2
                 With Blizzard Strayer (4) and Cryo Resonance, this weapon overcrits, so try to avoid getting Crit Rate substats.
              - b: "Aquila Favonia:"
              - >2
                 While Aquila has Physical Damage% as a main stat, which is basically useless on Ayaka, it is still a good statstick as it has a high base ATK and ATK% buff from the passive, however, it's not a huge upgrade over the other 4 star options and there might be a character which can utilize this weapon better (such as Bennett).
              - b: "Skyward Blade: "
              - >
                The Energy Recharge main stat provided from this sword makes
                Ayaka comfortable in terms of having a good burst uptime, try to
                avoid getting Energy Recharge substats since the weapon already
                provides you with enough Energy Recharge.
              - b: "Amenoma Kageuchi: "
              - >
                Lowers Ayaka's Energy Recharge requirement which allows her to
                allocate some of her Energy Recharge substats to other offensive
                substats. This weapon is also free and craftable while being
                competitive with other 4 star and even some 5 star weapons as
                well on the list.
              - b: "Blackcliff Longsword: "
              - >
                Due to Ayaka's burst snapshotting, her burst is unable to
                benefit from the ATK buff from this weapon's passive on the
                first rotation (since you cast it immediately before defeating
                an opponent).
              - b: "Harbinger of Dawn: "
              - A good Crit statstick if you can keep the requirements up
                (having >90% HP).

                and even then, she's still completely replaceable by other
                characters.
              - b: " She can be utilized on a Freeze team "
              - "where she can be a battery and nuke at the same time since she
                provides 5 Cryo particles on her Elemental Skill. "
              - b: She can also be utilized on a Melt team
              - " where you can melt her Elemental Burst for quite a decent
                amount of damage."

              - "\n"
              - b: "Polar Star: "
              - >
                Forcing to get Polar stacks isn't worth due to consuming extra
                time to get those stacks.
              - b: "The Stringless: "
              - >
                Placement was considering Aloy is used on a Reverse Melt team.
                On Reverse Melt Aloy, Stringless especially at higher refinement
                levels can pull ahead of Thundering Pulse.
              - b: "Prototype Crescent: "
              - >
                Assumes the passive is active by proccing a weak point shot.
                This weapon especially at higher refinement levels can be as
                good as a Skyward Harp.
              - b: "Sacrificial Bow: "
              - A pretty decent option to make Aloy a Cryo battery as her
                Elemental Skill provides 5 Cryo particles.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Sets:"
              - "\n"
              - b: "Blizzard Strayer (4): "
              - >
                This artifact set is best used on a Freeze-focused Aloy as it
                provides a ton of Crit Value.
              - b: "Wanderer's Troupe (2): "
              - >
                This artifact set bonus only benefits a Melt-focused Aloy,
                Elemental Mastery provides nothing on a Freeze Aloy.
              - b: "Noblesse Oblige (4): "
              - Aloy is one of the best Noblesse holders since she has low
                energy requirements and cooldown for her Elemental Burst.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Main Stat and Substats Priority: "
              - "\n"

              total EM, this is why you want to stack as much Elemental Mastery
              as possible in her artifacts. As a support, most of Sucrose's
              value lies on her Ascension 1 and 4 talents, hence leveling her
              other talents (Normal Attack, Skill, Burst) is not required.

              - b: " It offers 48% ATK boost to the character you swap to "
              - which is equivalent to 1 main stat. This buffs your DPS more
                compared to Sacrificial Fragments which gives ~44EM, equivalent

              a priority, such as Freeze teams or an Anemo battery for Xiao. In
              such situations it's better for Sucrose to use Thrilling Tales of
              the Dragon Slayers.

          - p: Sayu does more damage with EM builds and heals more with ATK hybrid builds,
              Healing Bonus hat can be used for better heals while maintaining
              respectable damage. Note that Sayu wants a large amount of energy
              recharge when used as the only anemo slot on the team (200%ish).

                 Wolf's Gravestone is a universal claymore that is capable of buffing your teammates along with providing more healing in Sayu's case. It is best used once you achieve your ER threshold.

              - When running this set, make sure you do Press Cast and not Hold
                Cast, as the Hold Cast Skill Cooldown would be too long for you
                to refresh your stacks.

              - This weapon can lower your ER% requirements from anywhere
                between ~150% to no additional ER% needed, depending on the
                number of stacks on the passive and the refinement of this
                weapon. As such, at higher refines / more stacks on the passive,
                this weapon can perform better than Skyward Blade, while at
                lower refines / less stacks, it can perform worse.

                The ranking here only assumes Jean's personal damage and not the
                utility it gives. If you want to furthermore buff your main DPS,
                you can give this sword to Jean as she can trigger
                Freedom-Sworn's skill relatively easily since Anemo is always
                trigger.

                 Another option for providing utilities to the team. This set gives a 20% partywide ATK boost after Jean casts her Elemental Burst.
              - b: "Ocean-Hued Clam (4): "
              - The best set for Jean's personal damage, as the damage it deals
                scales with Jean's burst healing. However, because Jean's total
                damage output is on the low end, it is generally recommended to
                prioritize utility options such as Noblesse Oblige or
                Viridescent Venerer over this set.

                Because of this, high burst uptime is required and so weapons
                with EM and ER passives are preferred. "

                  Regarding Talent Priorities:

                If you prefer more damage than healing, prioritize Elemental
                Skill over Elemental Burst since it scales better.

                For Support Jean, you can either go for more ATK for stronger heals, but relatively lower Burst uptime, or more ER for lower heals, but higher Burst uptime. Choosing between these two is up to personal preference, although if another Anemo character is on the team, Jean has very little energy problem and can potentially go full Sub DPS build.

        tips:
          - p: Make sure you don't immediately swap away after casting Burst, you need to be
              on-field for VV 4-set perk to proc on swirl first.(E > Q to avoid
              this issue)
          - p: You can infuse elements onto Venti's Burst if you walk up with an element
              status on you. (e.g. Bennett Burst > Venti Burst > Walk up to
              infuse Pyro)

                While terrible for personal damage, this weapon allows Venti to
                provide more energy for his teammates, while also covering his

                 so it is not suggested to use his Elemental Skill during Elemental Burst.
                Start off a fight by casting the skill of your Anemo Battery and then casting his skill twice then cast your burst immediately. You will want to be half way through your burst animation before the particles reach you, so this way you can start off your burst with a portion of the energy gauge already filled.
              - b: "You'll want to pair Xiao with another Anemo character "
              - (Venti, Sucrose, Jean or Anemo Traveler) to help him gain energy
                while his Elemental Burst is on cooldown. Xiao's Elemental Burst
                ends when you swap to another character. Although he has two
                charges of his Elemental Skill, only ONE charge comes back per
                cooldown.

              - >2
                 With a proper anemo battery (e.g. Sucrose), Xiao needs as little as 120-130% ER to maintain a high burst uptime. In these scenarios, unless there are no ER from substats, you should always go for a non-ER weapon as it will result in more damage.
              - b: "Calamity Queller: "
              - This weapon has a really high Base ATK, which means you benefit
                more from ATK% buffs (e.g. Thrilling Tales of the Dragon
                Slayers) if compared with other weapons.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Sets: "
              - Prioritize Viridescent Venerer over the other 2 +18% ATK sets if
                there are external ATK% buff sources on your team.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Main Stats: "
              - Anemo DMG% goblets are recommended for Xiao. ATK% goblets serve
                as a good alternative for him.

                regular ATK-EM/Anemo/Crit build as long as there are 2+ enemies
                due to the amount of swirls involved. Because of this, an ADC
                (Attack/Damage/Crit) build isn't recommended unless he is in a

                 Having Sacrificial Sword or a second Anemo character in the team will also help reduce the needs for ER and prioritize EM substats more.

                 In teams where you can meet energy requirements without needing the extra particles from Favonius Sword this is a better choice with stronger personal damage and buffing. Also at high refinements (R4-R5) it starts beating Favonius Sword in team energy generation too.
              - b: "Iron Sting: "
              - Iron Sting will yield the joint highest upfront EM and teamwide

                   if you manage to meet his energy needs or simply don't need more than one rotation, this would be the better option if compared to the Energy Recharge weapons.

        tips: Ningguang's Elemental Skill has a 6 second internal cooldown on generating
          energy, so for the sake of maintaining Elemental Burst uptime, wait 6
          seconds to cast again if you need energy. It also breaks when casted
          on top of another Geo Structure, you can intentionally use a structure
          to break your first screen.
        notes:
          - p: Due to Ningguang having a really low Base ATK and no ATK conversion
              mechanics, external ATK buffers such as Bennett is recommended as
              a support for Ningguang to bump up her ATK stat.

            allows his teammates to gain the 3 Geo 15% Geo DMG% bonus for a

                flat DEF (1 Geo), Interruption Resistance (2 Geo) and Geo DMG%
                Bonus (3 Geo) for your active character standing inside the

                placed banners in the process, it also pulls in nearby Elemental

                need to run the recommended ER% sets, which means you can opt
                for this instead.

                 can be considered when Gorou is using Favonius Warbow to trigger the passive comfortably.
              - b: ER% substats can usually be more important than getting the right mainstat,
              - " as Gorou's damage contribution to a team is negligible, while
                being able to get Energy for his Burst is a lot more important."

                This section is dedicated to utilising the Geo Traveler's Geo
                Burst damage capabilities. As their Elemental Skill and Burst
                have high multipliers, short cooldowns, and require very little
                field time, the Traveler is recommended to be played as a
                quickswap style Sub-DPS.

                The weapon ranking is considering KQM standard with Geo resonance and Noblesse (4) buff. Read the In-depth Guide for more insight on different scenarios.

                  Regarding Artifact Sets:
                  Emblem of Severed Fate (4): 
              - While this set slightly falls behind the first two in terms of
                personal damage, it is still recommended to run this set due to
                how Resin efficient the domain is.
              - b: |-
                  
                  Thundersoother (4)/Lavawalker (4): 
              - These sets will provide the highest personal damage
              - b: " only if their 4 piece set effects can be kept active consistently"
              - " (i.e. with a consistent pyro/electro aura from
                Xiangling/Raiden/Fischl). It is "
              - b: not recommended
              - " to farm this set purely for the traveller as the resin
                efficiency is poor. "
              - b: |-
                  
                  Noblesse Oblige (4): 
              - This set focuses more on providing an ATK buff to the team than
                the Traveler's personal damage. It can be paired with a
                Favonius/Sacrificial Sword for the Traveler to provide more
                utility to the team.

              - Most of the time, especially on a HP-focused Zhongli, casting
                Elemental Burst is a DPS loss due to the cast time, which is why
                you'd only want to cast Elemental Burst for the Crowd Control it
                offers, and not for damage.
          - p: Note that if paired with Xingqiu and/or Beidou, the damage reduction from
              orbitals from Xingqiu's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst and/or
              Beidou's Elemental Burst can be utilized on Zhongli's shield,

          - p: Zhongli can be utilized as a Geo Burst damage dealer due to his short
              Elemental Burst cooldown (12s) and low energy cost (40 Energy).
              His Elemental Skill Hold Cast (Shield) scales with HP and at
              Ascension 4, you would unlock a talent that allows your Elemental
              Burst to scale with 33% of Zhongli's Max HP, making him a great
              source of Shield and damage.
          - p:
              - b: |
                  Regarding Artifact Main Stats:
              - ATK sands provides more damage than HP sands, but it does have
                lesser Shield HP. If you want more Shield HP, you can consider
                running a HP sands.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Sets:"
              - "\n"
              - b: "Noblesse Oblige (2) Archaic Petra (2): "
              - >
                On lower ER requirements where Zhongli doesn't need to worry
                about his energy needs, this set pulls ahead of Emblem of
                Severed Fate (4).
              - b: "Noblesse Oblige (4):"
              - >2
                 This set provides Zhongli more utility when casting his Elemental Burst, you can use this set on Zhongli if there is nobody else on the team who's equipping this set.
              - b: "Tenacity of the Millelith (4): "
              - Just like Noblesse Oblige (4), this set provides Zhongli with
                more utility if his Elemental Skill hits an enemy. This set also
                provides Zhongli with stronger shields.

        tips: Albedo's Elemental Skill particle generation is completely RNG like
          Zhongli, but with better odds.
        notes:
          - p: Albedo is a character that can summon a Geo Construct from his Elemental
              Skill which deals damage on a 2 second interval whenever enemies
              in the field are damaged. His Elemental Burst provides 125 EM to
              the party, which is good on teams that rely on amplification
              reactions, such as Vaporize. It is worth noting that since his
              stat priority is focused on DEF (Elemental Skill scaling), you
              might want to skip casting Elemental Burst if your team doesn't
              benefit from the 125 EM buff. Another option is to build him with
              ATK-DEF Hybrid, which ends up with lower Skill damage but higher
              Burst damage.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Weapon Choices:"
              - "\n"
              - b: "Harbinger of Dawn:"
              - >2
                 Albedo's Elemental Skill scales with Defense, which is why the Base ATK from the weapon doesn't matter that much. Harbinger of Dawn offers a lot of Crit stats which is why it is one of the strongest weapons for him despite being a 3 star weapon. The downside of this weapon is that you'd need to keep Albedo's HP at 90% or higher to benefit from the passive, so it might be annoying to use against certain enemies which has a HP lowering debuff, even when off-field, such as Corrosion.
              - b: "Mistsplitter Reforged:"
              - >2
                 Realistically you are only able to get 2 stacks of this weapon's passive and this requires setup. Generally just use Harbinger of Dawn instead and give your Mistsplitter Reforged to another sword DPS character.
              - b: "Freedom-Sworn:"
              - " Equipping this weapon will decrease Albedo's own damage
                significantly but he is one of the better Freedom-Sworn holders
                since he can trigger the passive quite easily to buff your other
                party members."
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Sets:"
              - "\n"
              - b: "Husk of Opulent Dreams (4):"
              - >2
                 Due to Albedo's skill snapshotting upon cast, you need to either wait ~12 seconds before starting a domain/fight to reach max stacks or recast his skill to benefit from the DEF and Geo DMG bonus provided by the 4 piece set effect.
              - b: "Tenacity of the Milelith (4):"
              - >2
                 This set is used for the 4 piece set effect which has good uptime on Albedo. Worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.
              - b: "Noblesse Oblige (4):"
              - " If you don't have another character in your party that has
                this set, you can use this set on Albedo. You might want to get
                some Energy Recharge substats to maintain your Elemental Burst
                uptime for this. It is also worth noting that this set decreases
                your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other
                offensive sets."
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Substats Priority:"
              - >-
                
                ATK and Energy Recharge substats are only valuable on a Hybrid Albedo that casts his Elemental Burst.

          - p: Arataki Itto is a Geo DPS Character who takes advantage of his Elemental
              Burst's ATK boost and Geo infusion to deal significant damage
              during its uptime. His combos involve stacking and unleashing his
              Charged Attacks, named Arataki Kesagiri. Arataki Kesagiri consumes
              no stamina and can be casted continuously as long as he has
              Superlative Superstrength stacks. Superlative Superstrength is
              capped at 5 stacks at any given time, and Itto gets those stacks
              when his 2nd and 4th Normal Attack string hits an enemy.
              Activating his Elemental Burst allows his 1st and 3rd Normal
              Attack to also generate stacks. Itto's Elemental Skill deals
              damage to enemies on cast and summons a taunt, Ushi, which is
              considered a Geo Construct. This initial cast damage grants Itto 1
              Superlative Superstrength stack, and upon Ushi leaving the field,
              Itto is granted another stack. When Ushi takes damage, Itto gains
              a stack (capped at 1 stack per 2 seconds). Itto's Elemental Burst
              converts his Normal and Charged Attacks into Geo DMG, increases
              Itto's Normal Attack Speed and converts a portion of Itto's
              current DEF to ATK.

                 When using Husk of Opulent Dreams, Serpent Spine stacks are prioritized over Husk of the Opulent Dreams stacks due to their conflicting nature in gaining stacks (Off-field and on-field).

                Can be a great or bad weapon for Itto depending on your ER

                generation from your party members or ER from subs), the less
                useful this weapon becomes.

                DMG when shielded. Crystallize can be unreliable so a consistent
                shielder is preferred, such as Zhongli."
