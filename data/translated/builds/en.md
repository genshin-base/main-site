[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/albedo/) from Albedo Mains + KQM


# === characters.#albedo.roles.#off-field_dps.tips ===

Albedo's Elemental Skill particle generation is completely RNG like Zhongli, but with better odds.


# === characters.#albedo.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

Albedo is a character that can summon a Geo Construct from his Elemental Skill which deals damage on a 2 second interval whenever enemies in the field are damaged. His Elemental Burst provides 125 EM to the party, which is good on teams that rely on amplification reactions, such as Vaporize. It is worth noting that since his stat priority is focused on DEF (Elemental Skill scaling), you might want to skip casting Elemental Burst if your team doesn't benefit from the 125 EM buff. Another option is to build him with ATK-DEF Hybrid, which ends up with lower Skill damage but higher Burst damage.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Primordial Jade Cutter](#weapon:primordial-jade-cutter)<br>
On a Hybrid build where Albedo casts his Elemental Burst, this weapon can be a better option than Cinnabar Spindle on certain situations, such as AoE where Albedo's Burst hits multiple enemies or when there are external ATK buffs like Bennett's Burst. On a pure Elemental Skill focused Albedo or Single Target situations for Hybrid Albedo, Cinnabar Spindle is the better option, so choose wisely.

[Harbinger of Dawn](#weapon:harbinger-of-dawn)<br>
 Albedo's Elemental Skill scales with Defense, which is why the Base ATK from the weapon doesn't matter that much. Harbinger of Dawn offers a lot of Crit stats which is why it is one of the strongest weapons for him despite being a 3 star weapon. The downside of this weapon is that you'd need to keep Albedo's HP at 90% or higher to benefit from the passive, so it might be annoying to use against certain enemies which has a HP lowering debuff, even when off-field, such as Corrosion.

[Mistsplitter Reforged](#weapon:mistsplitter-reforged)<br>
 Realistically you are only able to get 2 stacks of this weapon's passive and this requires setup. Generally just use Harbinger of Dawn instead and give your Mistsplitter Reforged to another sword DPS character.

[Freedom-Sworn](#weapon:freedom-sworn)<br>
Equipping this weapon will decrease Albedo's own damage significantly but he is one of the better Freedom-Sworn holders since he can trigger the passive quite easily to buff your other party members.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Husk of Opulent Dreams (4)](#artifact:husk-of-opulent-dreams)<br>
Due to Albedo's skill snapshotting upon cast, you need to either wait \~12 seconds before starting a domain/fight to reach max stacks or recast his skill to benefit from the DEF and Geo DMG bonus provided by the 4 piece set effect.

[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)<br>
This set is used for the 4 piece set effect which has good uptime on Albedo. Worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.

[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)<br>
If you don't have another character in your party that has this set, you can use this set on Albedo. You might want to get some Energy Recharge substats to maintain your Elemental Burst uptime for this. It is also worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.

**Regarding Artifact Substats Priority**

ATK and Energy Recharge substats are only valuable on a Hybrid Albedo that casts his Elemental Burst.


# === characters.#aloy.roles.#burst_support.notes ===

Aloy is much preferred as a Burst Support over Main DPS as getting coil stacks for her Cryo infusion can be quite unreliable. **Aloy needs 4 coil stacks to get the Cryo infusion and you can only get 1 stack every 0.1 seconds** which is quite hard to do considering the Bomblets are scattered all over the place. One thing to note regarding Aloy's coil stacks is that **she can still get coil stacks even when she's off-field.**

Aloy is very niche as she only performs well in certain comps and even then, she's still completely replaceable by other characters. **She can be utilized on a Freeze team** where she can be a battery and nuke at the same time since she provides 5 Cryo particles on her Elemental Skill. **She can also be utilized on a Melt team** where you can melt her Elemental Burst for quite a decent amount of damage.

**Regarding Weapon Choice**

[Polar Star](#weapon:polar-star)<br>
Forcing to get Polar stacks isn't worth due to consuming extra time to get those stacks.

[The Stringless](#weapon:the-stringless)<br>
Placement was considering Aloy is used on a Reverse Melt team. On Reverse Melt Aloy, Stringless especially at higher refinement levels can pull ahead of Thundering Pulse.

[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)<br>
Assumes the passive is active by proccing a weak point shot. This weapon especially at higher refinement levels can be as good as a Skyward Harp.

[Sacrificial Bow](#weapon:sacrificial-bow)<br>
A pretty decent option to make Aloy a Cryo battery as her Elemental Skill provides 5 Cryo particles.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

Elemental Mastery is only an option if your Aloy is played on a Reverse Melt team as it provides nothing to a Freeze Aloy.

[Blizzard Strayer (4)](#artifact:blizzard-strayer)<br>
This artifact set is best used on a Freeze-focused Aloy as it provides a ton of Crit Value.

[Wanderer's Troupe (2)](#artifact:wanderers-troupe)<br>
This artifact set bonus only benefits a Melt-focused Aloy, Elemental Mastery provides nothing on a Freeze Aloy.

[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)<br>
Aloy is one of the best Noblesse holders since she has low energy requirements and cooldown for her Elemental Burst.


# === characters.#amber.roles.#dps.notes ===

Amber DPS will be focused on maximizing Charged Shot damage on enemy weak spots as Amber's Ascension 4 Talent increases ATK by 15% for 10s after hitting a weak spot. Crit is also guaranteed when you land your shot on a weak spot so we aim to maximize Crit DMG with little to no dependance on Crit Rate, this could change after \[C4\].

After \[C4\]**,** the playstyle catering towards her Skill damage becomes available, with this build you will want to run Crimson Witch of Flames (4) while trying to maintain the 1:2 Crit Ratio for more frequent nukes. This playstyle is safer, more consistent and has more AoE damage to play compared to Charge Shot Amber.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Shimenawa's Reminiscence](#artifact:shimenawas-reminiscence)<br>
At \[C4\] this set will beat out Wanderer's Troupe for Amber Charged Shot Main DPS.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)<br>
This bow will beat Skyward Harp if it's \[R2+\].

[Hamayumi](#weapon:hamayumi)<br>
This bow will beat Sharpshooter's Oath \[R5\] if it's \[R2+\].


# === characters.#amber.roles.#support.notes ===

Due to her poor scalings, this section is dedicated to a low-investment build that provides utility and shieldbreaking capabilities by abusing her quick Pyro application on her Elemental Burst. Due to her energy generation being extremely poor, her Energy Recharge options are prioritized.

**Regarding [Instructors (4)](#artifact:instructor)**

This set is preferred over 4p Noblesse Oblige when Amber is used as support in a Hu Tao vaporize team.


# === characters.#ayaka.roles.#dps.mainStats.notes ===

Circlet main stat will be dependant on your overall stats, depending on your stats, one can be better than the other


# === characters.#ayaka.roles.#dps.subStats.notes ===

Crit Rate loses value here assuming you're running Blizzard Strayer (4), if you're not using that artifact set, then it has the same priority as Crit DMG


# === characters.#ayaka.roles.#dps.tips ===

Ayaka's Charged Attack, Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst hits enemies inside Venti's Elemental Burst.

Her Elemental Burst also stays in place on frozen enemies and slightly knocks enemies away when they're not frozen.


# === characters.#ayaka.roles.#dps.notes ===

Kamisato Ayaka is a pretty straightforward DPS that **deals most of her damage from her Elemental Burst.** She has very high scalings on her burst at the cost of it being 80 energy. You will likely need **another Cryo battery on the team** to provide energy for her (Diona, Kaeya, Rosaria, etc). She has a **special dash** (like Mona) and after she dashes, she will get a Cryo infusion on her Normal Attacks. Ensure you always have this bonus active to maximise your rotation damage.

She can be played on a **permafreeze team** (paired with a Hydro enabler such as Mona, Xingqiu, or even Barbara) where she could gain huge benefits from the **Blizzard Strayer (4) artifact set.** Blizzard Strayer (4) piece gives a huge amount of stats on a Freeze team, so try to get this artifact set as fast as you can. Her Elemental Burst also sticks on frozen enemies, but it also has a small hitbox so you need to position it well so that it can hit multiple bigger enemies.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Aquila Favonia](#weapon:aquila-favonia)<br>
While Aquila has Physical Damage% as a main stat, which is basically useless on Ayaka, it is still a good statstick as it has a high base ATK and ATK% buff from the passive.

**[Primordial Jade Cutter](#weapon:primordial-jade-cutter)**<br>
With Blizzard Strayer (4) and Cryo Resonance, this weapon overcrits, so avoid getting Crit Rate substats.

**[Skyward Blade](#weapon:skyward-blade), [Blackcliff Longsword](#weapon:blackcliff-longsword), [The Black Sword](#weapon:the-black-sword), [Amenoma Kageuchi](#weapon:amenoma-kageuchi)**<br>
These 4 weapons will give a similar output, so it's not worth getting or building another when you already have one. Depends on how much Energy Recharge you're running, how much stacks your Blackcliff has, how much time you're gonna spend doing Normal Attacks, and how much you value the passive on Amenoma since it gives you leeway in building Energy Recharge, one can be better than the other. If you're running **Skyward Blade** or **Amenoma Kageuchi** (especially with higher refines), avoid getting Energy Recharge substats as their stats / passives assist in elemental burst generation significantly.

[The Flute](#weapon:the-flute)<br>
Offers slightly more damage potential than **Amenoma Kageuchi,** with the tradeoff being losing Kageuchi's energy generation. Decide for yourself which is better for your team and rotations.


# === characters.#barbara.roles.#dps.tips ===

Barbara's skill gives you a pulse of healing every 5 seconds, every pulse will imbue you with a Hydro status, that means it can be used for status-cleansing (Pyro in specific, while other elements may take more pulses).

Take note that Hydro reacting with Cryo status will freeze you in place, her skill should be used in consideration of the environment


# === characters.#barbara.roles.#dps.notes ===

Use Charged Attacks if you're going to be doing Vaporize DPS, Normal Attacks are for Electro-Charge DPS.<br>
Always activate your skill first, as it reduces stamina consumption and if you have **\[C2\],** it will give 15% Hydro Damage Bonus.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Memory of Dust](#weapon:memory-of-dust)**<br>
This weapon requires stacks to be utilized, and in Vaporize DPS comps, you usually don't want to give up the first few Vaporize hits to stack up Memory of Dust's perk.


# === characters.#barbara.roles.#support.notes ===

Use Elemental Skill and/or Elemental Burst and immediately switch. Generally, run ER if you want more consistent heals from Elemental Burst.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Maiden Beloved (2) ](#artifact:maiden-beloved)+ [Tenacity of the Millelith (2)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
Acts as a place holder set for Maiden Beloved if you want pure healing and have not been able to gather Maiden Beloved (4) yet.

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**<br>
Usable option if you want Barbara to have more utility, but do note that Barbara might have bad uptime on this set.


# === characters.#beidou.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/beidou/) from Beidou Mains + KQM


# === characters.#beidou.roles.#off-field_dps.subStats.notes ===

Prioritize Energy Recharge first if you can't burst off cooldown


# === characters.#beidou.roles.#off-field_dps.tips ===

Beidou's skill grants you an Electro status for a brief moment upon holding it. This means it can be used for status-cleansing (No particular effective element). Can only be done on herself.


# === characters.#beidou.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Serpent Spine](#weapon:serpent-spine)**<br>
This weapon can be considered over Wolf's Gravestone for a Sub DPS Beidou, while Wolf's Gravestone is equipped onto another Claymore DPS character with higher field time. Beidou can effectively make use of the full stacks, as long as you have her stacks up before swapped away, the stacks will be maintained even while off-field since her Elemental Burst snapshots her stats. **Serpent Spine outperforms Wolf's Gravestone by a significant margin when Bennett/Sara ATK buffs are applied.**

**[Redhorn Stonethresher](#weapon:redhorn-stonethresher)**<br>
Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you're getting, this weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in personal damage.

**[Akuoumaru ](#weapon:akuoumaru)(260 team energy assumed)**<br>
Akuoumaru outperforms **Skyward Pride** on a **low ER requirement Beidou** (where she is paired with other Electro characters to battery her energy needs). At **\[R3+\],** it becomes exponentially better and comes very close to **Serpent Spine** and **Wolf's Gravestone.**

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Emblem of Severed Fate (4)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate)**<br>
Even after considering the 4-piece set effect, you should refrain from investing into **Energy Recharge** beyond what is needed to burst off cooldown as it will result in a **damage loss** as compared to prioritising offensive stats such as **ATK/Crit.** In team comps where Beidou has **low ER requirements** (i.e. when paired with electro batteries), a **Noblesse Oblige (2) / Thundering Fury (2) / +18% ATK set (2) \[Choose Two\]** will outperform **Emblem of Severed Fate (4).**

**[Thundersoother (4)](#artifact:thundersoother)**<br>
This set seeks to maximise your Burst damage in an Electro-Charged or mono Electro comps, take note that the set could be rendered useless when against enemies with non-Electro elements imbued.

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**<br>
This set could be considered if your Beidou can get her Elemental Burst off cooldown and the team doesn't have a Noblesse Oblige (4) user yet, do note that sometimes Beidou doesn't benefit from the ATK buff from the 4 piece set if she's the set holder, so Beidou as a Noblesse Oblige (4) holder isn't really recommended.

**[Scholar (2) ](#artifact:scholar)+ [The Exile (2)](#artifact:the-exile)**<br>
This set acts as a cheap beginner's option to provide Beidou with 40% Energy Recharge to help maintain her Elemental Burst uptime.


# === characters.#bennett.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/bennett/) from KQM


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#dps.mainStats.notes ===

EM sands is generally > ATK%, but substat quality and weapon choice can potentially favour ATK% sands.


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#dps.subStats.notes ===

Elemental Mastery has lower priority than ATK% when using Iron Sting


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#dps.talents.notes ===

Normal Attack is only a priority if you have C6 Bennett


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#dps.tips ===

Bennett's EB grants you a pyro status as long as your characters are within his burst AoE (Cryo in specific, since Pyro > Cryo).

For that, cast EB with Bennett, switch to the character imbued with Cryo and walk on Bennett's Burst field

Upon entering burst field, the Pyro status will continuously imbue you with Pyro, reacting with other elements on you and eventually removing them.


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[The Alley Flash](#weapon:the-alley-flash)<br>
The Alley Flash has the potential to beat Iron Sting \[R5\]**,** but this requires the passive to be up, whenever damaged, your passive is disabled for 5 seconds and you could be losing out a lot of damage, especially if you are constantly being damaged.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Crimson Witch of Flames (4)](#artifact:crimson-witch-of-flames)<br>
This set works best with Chongyun on the same team for consistent Melt.<br>
Assuming a **Melt/Vaporize** team, **Crimson Witch (4) is your best set for damage.**<br>
Pyro Damage Bonus will always be the best for cup. The combo for the highest Melt/Vaporize damage is The Black Sword and EM sand. \[R1\] Iron Sting and EM sand turns out to have diminishing returns and isn't as good, but \[R2+\] Iron Sting is a different question because better buffs. (Assuming you don't have a whale build's CR/CD stats, in which case Aquila with EM sands is just flat out better.)

[Thundering Fury (4)](#artifact:thundering-fury)<br>
This set **works best if paired with Electro supports such as Beidou and Fischl/Lisa,** as it allows Bennett to accomplish 2 things: <br>
1) Rapidly spam E for raw pyro damage + overload<br>
2) Generate tons of energy for the entire team.<br>
**Thundering Fury (4) also allows Bennett to quickly break the shields of the Abyss Lectors** in the Spiral Abyss. This comp is generally only recommended for those with Beidou on C2/C6.

**It's worth noting that the main-stat artifacts you want to farm for 4-TF Bennett varies from the main-stat artifacts you'd normally go for in other builds. Instead of ATK/EM, Pyro, and Crit, you'd instead want to go for EM/Pyro/EM on a 4-TF Bennett.** As such, this also means weapons that have EM substats such as Iron sting take priority over other swords.

It is also worth noting that with 4 TF, Primordial Jade Cutter is able to overtake MIstsplitter Reforged due to its massive Crit Rate% substat, which allows you to vape consistently despite the lack of Crit Dmg/Crit Rate subs in your artifacts. This assumes that your EM mainstat pieces (sands, goblet, and circlet) lack Crit Rate substats. However, in the rare occasion that your EM pieces manage to roll plenty of Crit subs, Mistsplitter easily overtakes Jade Cutter.

Recommended amount of ER%: 130-150%. Worth noting that **with Thundering Fury (4), you have a lot more leeway when it comes to ER.**


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#burst_support.subStats.notes ===

Prioritize Energy Recharge first if you can't burst off cooldown


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#burst_support.tips ===

Recommended amount of ER%: 180-200


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#burst_support.notes ===

A Burst Support Bennett **completely ignores the need for excess healing potential** and is aimed for people who prefer to squeeze out more damage instead. On this build, Bennett is built with offensive stats like ATK%, Pyro Damage, and Crit stats while having a good amount of Energy Recharge to burst off cooldown.<br>
**Prioritize Energy Recharge before offensive stats if you cannot cast your Elemental Burst off cooldown.**


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#support.tips ===

Recommended amount of ER%: 200+


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#support.notes ===

**Heals** from his Elemental Burst scale off of **HP,** while his **damage buff** from Burst only scales with your **base ATK (Character Base ATK stat and Weapon Base ATK stat)**

**DO NOT increase Bennett's constellation from 5 to 6** unless he is in a Pyro team and you know what you're doing. This is because Bennett **turns all of your melee on-field character's Auto Attacks into Pyro,** which means that Bennett will lose a lot of his team comp potential.

Although Bennett is usually considered a healer, he already heals a lot even without necessarily building for HP%, **if you find it unnecessary to build for HP%, you can consider building him as a Sub DPS.**

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Mistsplitter Reforged](#weapon:mistsplitter-reforged), [Aquila Favonia](#weapon:aquila-favonia)<br>
These weapons have the highest Base ATK in the game which is why it is ranked quite high. It is assuming you have enough Energy Recharge so you still can burst off cooldown for the maximum ATK buff.

[Freedom-Sworn](#weapon:freedom-sworn)<br>
In comps where Bennett can reliably trigger reactions (and thus trigger this sword's passive), the buffs provided by this weapon will be stronger than Aquila Favonia.

[The Alley Flash](#weapon:the-alley-flash)<br>
This weapon currently has the highest Base ATK for a 4 star weapon (even more Base ATK than some 5 stars like Skyward Blade).

[Prototype Rancour](#weapon:prototype-rancour)<br>
This weapon has one of the highest Base ATK for a 4 Star weapon (and this is also a weapon you could craft from the Blacksmith)


# === characters.#chongyun.roles.#burst_support.tips ===

Chongyun's Elemental Burst is calculated as Claymore damage, which means it breaks Geo Structures/ Shields at a much easier rate and can proc shatter.


# === characters.#chongyun.roles.#burst_support.notes ===

Chongyun is much preferred as a Sub DPS/ Nuke over Main DPS as **his Normal Attack scalings are very low,** even when including Constellation 1. His **Elemental Burst on the other hand hits extremely hard** on later constellations and takes a much higher total damage portion over his Normal Attack. On top of that, you can Reverse Melt all 3 hits of his Elemental Burst on enemies applied with strong Pyro, such as Bennett's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst.

Chongyun is **very niche** as he only performs well in certain teams and can completely destroy the other. He is mainly used on a team as an **enabler,** be it for **Reverse Melt teams** (e.g. Melt DPS Bennett) or **Freeze teams** (e.g. Freeze DPS Kaeya). He also **does not function well with Physical teams** (e.g. Razor, Eula) as it renders his Elemental Skill useless because it converts their **Normal Attack damage from Physical to Cryo.** They're usually using a Physical Goblet, so if they got their Normal Attack converted from Physical to Cryo, **they won't benefit from Physical DMG Bonus** from the goblet, thus it's a DPS loss.

At **\[C2\],** his Elemental Skill **reduces ability cooldown that is casted within the zone by 15%.** This is one of the few abilities in the game that can reduce cooldown.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Serpent Spine](#weapon:serpent-spine)<br>
This weapon outperforms [Wolf's Gravestone](#weapon:wolfs-gravestone) if we only look at Chongyun's damage contribution **\[5 Stack Assumed\].** [Wolf's Gravestone](#weapon:wolfs-gravestone) is ranked higher as it provides more teamwide DPS and does not come with the need to acquire stacks before engaging in combat.

[Redhorn Stonethresher](#weapon:redhorn-stonethresher)<br>
Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you're getting, this weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in personal damage.

[Akuoumaru](#weapon:akuoumaru)<br>
At **\[R1\], Akuoumaru** beats [Luxurious Sea-Lord](#weapon:luxurious-sea-lord) if Chongyun is used in a team with **260 or greater** total team energy. [Akuoumaru](#weapon:akuoumaru) only beats [Luxurious Sea-Lord](#weapon:luxurious-sea-lord) if **\[R2\]** and above otherwise.

[Sacrificial Greatsword](#weapon:sacrificial-greatsword)<br>
This weapon is your best choice if faced in a situation where you heavily rely on Chongyun's Cryo infusion uptime.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)<br>
Chongyun is one of the best Noblesse holders since he has low energy requirements for his Elemental Burst.

**Regarding Talent Priority**

Prioritize Elemental Burst on a Melt team as it scales better than his Elemental Skill.<br>
Prioritize Elemental Skill on a Freeze team to furthermore extend the duration of the Cryo infusion.


# === characters.#diluc.roles.#dps.subStats.advices.2.notes ===

higher prio in Vaporize/Melt comps


# === characters.#diluc.roles.#dps.talents.notes ===

Worth noting that Diluc's constellations boost his Elemental Skill's damage, so talent prioritization can vary from player to player


# === characters.#diluc.roles.#dps.tips ===

You can interweave Normal Attacks while using his Elemental Skill.

ie. ES -> NA -> NA -> ES -> NA -> NA -> ES -> NA -> NA


# === characters.#diluc.roles.#dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Redhorn Stonethresher](#weapon:redhorn-stonethresher)<br>
Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you're getting, this weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in personal damage.

[Serpent Spine](#weapon:serpent-spine)<br>
Because Diluc's \[C2\] requires you to get hit to gain the ATK buff, it can potentially lead to a damage loss due to losing Serpent Spine stacks. However, when paired with **Zhongli,** the shield allows you to gain the \[C2\] buff while not losing any stacks - running Zhongli with \[C2\] Diluc is **highly recommended.**

[Blackcliff Slasher](#weapon:blackcliff-slasher)<br>
This weapon has excellent DPS potential when facing against crowds, but at the same time it's potential will not be utilized at single target situations.

[Rainslasher](#weapon:rainslasher)<br>
For obvious reasons, this weapon is only recommended when Diluc is in a team comp where he can consistently proc vaporize (i.e. when paired with Xingqiu). **Rainslasher will also outperform [Skyward Pride](#weapon:skyward-pride) at \[R3+\].** Due to its EM mainstat, it is recommended to go ATK% sands instead.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Crimson Witch of Flames (4)](#artifact:crimson-witch-of-flames)<br>
Generally the best go to set for Diluc due to how easily Diluc can stack the Pyro Damage effect, while his burst imbues his Normal/Charged Attacks with Pyro.

[Gladiator's Finale (4)](#artifact:gladiators-finale)<br>
For those who are still reluctant on farming for Crimson Witch of Flames (Pre-AR 45), this will still provide it a fairly decent increase in DPS as he still relies on his Normal Attacks mostly.

**Regarding Main Stats Choice**

If Diluc is run alongside Xingqiu where he can trigger vaporize very often, you can run EM sands as an alternative to ATK sands. EM boosts Diluc's reaction damage by a lot after all. Note that when Diluc's Pyro imbued basic attack is active, he can trigger Vaporize every 2 basic attacks due to internal cooldown.


# === characters.#diona.roles.#support.tips ===

Diona's Elemental Skill grants you a cryo shield which allows cleansing. Every time you swap characters with the shield up, it applies cryo. This acts as a cleanse.


# === characters.#diona.roles.#support.notes ===

The shielding Diona puts out should offset the need for healing from her burst. The damage boost from Noblesse Oblige (4) has more practical use. Additionally, her first constellation greatly increases her ultimate uptime, further lowering the healing needed.

As a support, Diona's typically used for three things; Shielding, Healing, and Cryo particle generation. Pairing Diona with Cryo carries such as Ganyu and Eula allows you to funnel energy into your DPS characters while providing them with quick shields for stagger resistance. Weapons such as Sacrificial Bow and Favonius Warbow greatly increase her potential as a battery.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Sacrificial Bow](#weapon:sacrificial-bow)**<br>
Prefered over Favonious especially at higher refinements due to having better Shield uptime.

**[Favonius Warbow](#weapon:favonius-warbow)**<br>
You will look to build some Crit Rate coverage to have a higher chance of triggering bow passive for energy.

**[Recurve Bow](#weapon:recurve-bow)**<br>
This bow will be your best choice for stronger shields, but it reduces Diona's burst uptime significantly due to no Energy Recharge on her weapon.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**<br>
This set provides an atk buff while also increasing burst damage - this set is usually used with healers because you want to use damage sets on other support units such as Xingqiu or Beidou.

**[Emblem of Severed Fate (2) ](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate)+ [Tenacity of the Milellith (2)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
Provides both ER and HP which are both valuable for a support diona, increasing ult uptime and healing strength respectively.

**Regarding Main Stat Choices**

Full Stack HP% is recommended if you want stronger shields but a weaker heal. You can use Healing Bonus Circlet if you want a nice balance between the two.

**Regarding Talent Priority**

Prioritise whichever your Diona is geared for (shielder or healer), if built for a balance between the two, level both equally.


# === characters.#eula.roles.#dps.tips ===

**Normal combo while no Burst**<br>
NA Spam > Tap Skill > NA Spam > Tap Skill

**Burst combo**<br>
Tap Skill > Burst > 4 NA > Hold Skill > 4 NA

**Burst combo that generates more energy at the cost of slightly less DPS**<br>
Tap Skill > Burst > Tap Skill > 4 NA > Dash Cancel > 2 NA > Hold Skill > 2 NA

**\*NA = Normal Attack**


# === characters.#eula.roles.#dps.notes ===

Eula's weapon rankings assume that you're running her with a Cryo battery (i.e. Diona) instead of Bennett. She would usually need 30%-60%+ Energy Recharge from substats depending on what team and Cryo batteries you use.

Eula's Elemental Burst does not snapshot. This means that any buffs Eula has upon casting Burst will not be taken into effect if the buff duration expires before the Lightfall Sword hits.

**Regarding Weapon Choice**

[Redhorn Stonethresher](#weapon:redhorn-stonethresher)<br>
Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you're getting this weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in personal damage.

[Skyward Pride](#weapon:skyward-pride)<br>
This weapon is more forgiving towards ER substats. If there is a Cryo battery unit in your team (Diona with Sacrificial Bow or Kaeya with Favonius Sword) or if your team generates enough particles on their own, Skyward Pride loses effectiveness compared to the above options.

[Akuoumaru](#weapon:akuoumaru)<br>
This weapon will outperform Luxurious Sea Lord at higher refinements.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Pale Flame (4)](#artifact:pale-flame)<br>
This is Eula's optimal artifact set and it relies on having a condition fulfilled in order to outperform Pale Flame (2) Bloodstained Chivalry (2). If you are able to sustain the conditional buff, you will be able to achieve a 50% Physical DMG Bonus + 18% ATK. Without using your Elemental Burst, you can sustain the Pale Flame's 4 piece set bonus because each stack lasts 7s and it refreshes per stack, and Eula's Elemental Skill cooldown is only 4 seconds when doing 1-taps, therefore you can keep the condition up. When using this set, it is recommended to not use Hold Skill cast until your Lightfall Sword is nearly about to end. This restriction is only for players who don't have Eula **\[C2+\].** Please visit the Ability Tips for her combo.

[Pale Flame (2)](#artifact:pale-flame) + [Bloodstained Chivalry (2)](#artifact:bloodstained-chivalry)<br>
This is a non-conditional, consistent artifact set that provides you a constant 50% Physical DMG bonus. While that by itself is amazing, Pale Flame (4) can outperform this set because it also has another 18% ATK buff and is easily maintained through her low tap skill cooldown.

Due to how Polar Star works, your optimal rotation would be different from other weapons:

**Skill (Burst) > NA > CA > Resummon Oz (To snapshot Polar Star stacks)**


# === characters.#fischl.roles.#dps.notes ===

\[C1\] is recommended to even start Fischl's DPS build, with Oz still contributing to Physical DPS even when he's off-field.

There is an animation cancelling technique with Fischl DPS. After 3 or 5 basic attacks, shoot an Aim Shot to reset your attack combo. The faster you can do this, the better it is. Only use this for animation cancelling when you're out of stamina since it can be pretty hard to replicate consistently.

**Regarding \[C6\] Fischl Build**

At **\[C6\],** Oz will be dealing about 60% of the DPS and it'd be better to invest on **Gladiator's Finale (2) Thundering Fury (2)** until you can obtain **Pale Flame (4)** with an Electro Goblet.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Skyward Harp ](#weapon:skyward-harp)and [Polar Star](#weapon:polar-star)**<br>
Due to the aforementioned Electro/Phys split at **\[C6\], Polar Star** will surpass **Skyward Harp.**

**[Viridescent Hunt](#weapon:the-viridescent-hunt)**<br>
Viridescent Hunt is a really good investment that even surpasses Amos in a situation where there are crowds of enemies, although it's not as efficient towards massive single targets or really agile targets. It offers crowd DPS that is severely lacking due to Fischl's single target attacks.

**[Mitternachts Waltz](#weapon:mitternachts-waltz)**<br>
Mitternachts Waltz would be prioritized over Amos if you manage to get refinement 5 for pure Physical build Fischl.

**[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)**<br>
If you manage to weave in a Charged Shot on enemy weak spots once every 9-10 seconds, Prototype Crescent could potentially offer more DPS, this weapon can be an option for those interested in a more challenging playstyle.


# === characters.#fischl.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

Elemental Burst and Skill both summon Oz, so make sure you're only using one at a time. Start with your Skill, use Burst for second Oz rotation and alternate. Hopefully, by the time your second/third round of Oz summoning is over, you'll have gained enough energy to repeat the loop.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[The Stringless](#weapon:the-stringless) and [Alley Hunter](#weapon:alley-hunter)**<br>
At \[R5\], both these weapons are roughly equivalent to [Thundering Pulse](#weapon:thundering-pulse) and [Skyward Harp](#weapon:skyward-harp).

**[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)**<br>
Ranking assumes hitting enemy's weak spot with Charged Shot everytime before summoning Oz.

**[Windblume Ode](#weapon:windblume-ode)**<br>
Ode only performs this well if Fischl ends up being the trigger for some reactions. If Fischl is used in a team comp where by there are **NO ELEMENTAL REACTIONS,** this weapon will be ranked below Mitternachts Waltz.

**[Mitternachts Waltz](#weapon:mitternachts-waltz)**<br>
This weapon will be ranked above Windblume Ode at \[R5\].

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Thundersoothers (4)](#artifact:thundersoother)**<br>
This artifact set will outperform Gladiator's Finale(2) Thundering Fury(2) if used in a team comp where an electro aura is always present (e.g. Electro/Electro-charged comps) therefore it is **highly recommended within this niche.**

**[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
Works as a low/no investment Fischl build. This set trades off Fischl's damage in return for a party wide 20 ATK% buff. **Not recommended to specifically farm this set for Fischl.** Only use this set if you have pieces while farming for the Pale Flame set for your Physical DPSes.


# === characters.#ganyu.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/ganyu/) from Ganyu Mains + KQM


# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#melt_dps.tips ===

In some teams and situations, using Ganyu's Elemental Burst can be detrimental to overall damage due to stealing Pyro aura, thus reducing the amount of CAs melting.


# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#melt_dps.notes ===

Ganyu's Level 2 Charged Shot applies two instances Cryo as they do not share the same ICD, which allows you to trigger Melt reaction twice for both damage instances. Charged Attack will be the majority of her damage output while neglecting her Skill/Burst damage contribution for most scenarios.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Amos' Bow](#weapon:amos-bow)<br>
Amos is an excellent weapon for Ganyu since her Level 2 Charge Shot Bloom extends arrow flight duration and you can get 3 stacks of Amos' passive even on point blank range.

[Hamayumi](#weapon:hamayumi)<br>
This weapon doesn't synergize well with Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4) due to its passive.

[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)<br>
At higher refinement levels with good uptime on its passive, it can potentially be on par with Skyward Harp. However, do bear in mind that not all enemies have weak spots that you can headshot, which does affect its performance significantly.

**Regarding Talent Priority**

Ganyu's Elemental Burst is low priority on a Melt Build since most of the times, you don't cast her burst at all so that it doesn't steal your Melt reaction.


# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#freeze_dps.tips ===

Try to not overcap on Crit Rate (within the range of 25%-45% Crit Rate) since Ganyu's A1 passive only affects her Charged Shot and subsequent Blooms.


# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#freeze_dps.notes ===

Freeze Ganyu gives a lot of i-frames since you would be spamming Elemental Burst from all of your party members off cooldown. Ganyu's Elemental Burst can deal a ton of damage based on how grouped the enemies are, due to the quadratic scaling on her Elemental Burst.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Polar Star](#weapon:polar-star)**<br>
This weapon is much harder to optimize with, due to having a very high Crit Rate stat resulting in your Crit Rate going well above 100%. However, if optimised properly **(i.e. very little Crit Rate substats),** it pulls quite far ahead of all the other options.

**[Amos' Bow](#weapon:amos-bow)**<br>
In quickswap heavy rotations (Ganyu Mona Venti Diona) where you usually don't do a lot of Charged Shots, this weapon performs worse than the other 5 star options listed.

**[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)**<br>
Similar to the Melt Build, this weapon at higher refinement levels and good passive uptime can pull ahead of some of the 5 star options such as [Thundering Pulse](#weapon:thundering-pulse) and [Skyward Harp](#weapon:skyward-harp). However, do bear in mind that not all enemies have weak spots that you can headshot, which does affect its performance significantly.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Blizzard Strayer (4)](#artifact:blizzard-strayer)**<br>
This set is the go to set for a Frozen team comp due to the huge stats it provides.


# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#off-field_dps.subStats.advices.0.notes ===

until needed


# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#off-field_dps.subStats.advices.3.notes ===

on a non Freeze comp


# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#off-field_dps.tips ===

When using her Elemental Burst, place her Elemental Skill in the AoE to taunt and keep enemies inside the zone for constant damage.

Make sure to hit enemies with her skill's initial damage and her explosion damage as they both regen energy for her ult.


# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

An Off-field DPS Ganyu shines brightly on a Freeze comp as she has 100% Elemental Burst uptime and her Elemental Burst buffs party members' Cryo Damage.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)<br>
This weapon might pull ahead of some of the other options if you activate the buff before casting Elemental Burst.

[Elegy for the End](#weapon:elegy-for-the-end)<br>
Offers party-wide Elemental Mastery and ATK buff which is quite nice on reaction heavy team comps.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Blizzard Strayer (4)](#artifact:blizzard-strayer)<br>
This set offers a huge amount of stats, use this set only if your Ganyu is used on a Freeze team.

[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)<br>
This set provides Ganyu with more utility so that she can buff your whole party's ATK by 20%.


# === characters.#gorou.roles.#support.tips ===

**\[C2\]** extends the duration of Gorou's Elemental Burst from 9 seconds to 12 seconds if you can obtain the required Crystallize shields. This allows his teammates to gain the 3 Geo 15% Geo DMG% bonus for a longer duration, so it's preferable to use Burst as your last ability before swapping into your DPS.


# === characters.#gorou.roles.#support.notes ===

Gorou is a Support character that can give increasing buffs to your party members from his Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst based on the number of Geo characters in your team (capped at 3). Casting his Elemental Skill sets up a banner which gives flat DEF (1 Geo), Interruption Resistance (2 Geo) and Geo DMG% Bonus (3 Geo) for your active character standing inside the banner radius. Casting his Elemental Burst creates a field following the active character which deals periodic damage and offers the same bonuses given by the Skill, destroying any placed banners in the process, it also pulls in nearby Elemental Shards created by Crystallize reactions. Due to his kit focusing on buffing DEF and Geo DMG, he's a specialised support geared towards Geo DPS that scales with DEF, such as Noelle or Itto. He can see niche use at **\[C6\]** with other Geo characters as well.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Elegy for the End](#weapon:elegy-for-the-end)<br>
Elegy offers a helpful ER substat alongside an EM and ATK% buff for your teammates. While not directly useful in teams centered around Noelle or Itto, this could possibly be a good choice for future Geo DPS characters, or in a team which utilizes Geo Resonance.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[The Exile (4)](#artifact:the-exile)<br>
Casting Elemental Burst regenerates a total of 6 Energy for each of your party member. This set reduces your Energy Requirements by a bit for all of your party members, which can be quite beneficial. Do note that this is a 4 star set so you're potentially missing out on 5 star stat scaling, which is a 34% difference in mainstat value and 25% difference in individual substat value.

[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)<br>
The effectiveness of this set increases if you've already met the ER requirement for Gorou. At that point, you'd no longer need to run the recommended ER% sets, which means you can opt for this instead.

**Regarding Artifact Mainstats and Substats Priority**

**DEF% mainstats and substats** (and potentially a **Healing Bonus** mainstat on Circlet) can be considered at **\[C4\]** due to being able to heal the active character based on his DEF during burst. This is useful if you plan to use him as a solo healer.

**Crit Rate circlet and substats** can be considered when Gorou is using Favonius Warbow to trigger the passive comfortably.

**ER% substats can usually be more important than getting the right mainstat,** as Gorou's damage contribution to a team is negligible, while being able to get Energy for his Burst is a lot more important.


# === characters.#hu-tao.roles.#dps.tips ===

When ending Hu Tao's combos with an Elemental Burst, if you do not jump/dash cancel the last charged attack, the Elemental Burst will still benefit from Hu Tao's Elemental Skill.

**cancels** when performing your Hu Tao combos as to maximize damage.<br>
**N2CJ** for **\[C0\]** and **N2CD** for **\[C1\].**<br>
**N3CJ/N3CD** can be used to conserve stamina at the cost of damage.

**\*N = Normal Attack, C = Charged Attack, J = Jump, D = Dash**


# === characters.#hu-tao.roles.#dps.notes ===

Hu Tao is most effective when used with Xingqiu to proc Vaporize/Freeze Melt reactions which utilizes her BiS Set, Crimson Witch of Flames (4). Freeze Melt refers to freezing enemies for Melt set up, since unlike Diluc or Klee, Hu Tao doesn't shatter frozen enemies.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Primordial Jade Winged-Spear](#weapon:primordial-jade-winged-spear)<br>
Is better than the \[R1\] variants of [Dragon's Bane](#weapon:dragons-bane) and [Deathmatch](#weapon:deathmatch) with ideal stacking. While this is a very strong weapon when fully stacked, maintaining the stacks on Hu Tao isn't ideal in realistic situations making the weapon less consistent than other options.

[Deathmatch](#weapon:deathmatch)<br>
Deathmatch is better than Dragon's Bane when you're not doing Vaporize.

[Blackcliff Pole](#weapon:blackcliff-pole)<br>
Despite seeming quite good due to the Crit DMG substat, Blackcliff at 1 stack performs only slightly better than an **\[R5\]** White Tassel in practice as it is difficult to maintain stacks consistently. It is not recommended to buy this weapon specifically for Hu Tao and should only be used if you already have one.

[Vortex Vanquisher](#weapon:vortex-vanquisher) and [Skyward Spine](#weapon:skyward-spine)<br>
Provides little to nothing to Hu Tao since she scales better with HP% than ATK% with every spear in the game. **Base ATK makes little difference on Hu Tao because she has a very high HP to ATK conversion cap.**

[White Tassel](#weapon:white-tassel)<br>
White Tassel requires your combos to be more focused on Normal Attacks (N2C over N1C) to make use of it's passive.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4)](#artifact:shimenawas-reminiscence)<br>
Provides higher AA damage than 4CW but lowers your Elemental Burst damage which hurts your AoE damage, also if you're unable to burst, it might cause survivability issues if you're not running a healer.

[Retracing Bolide (4)](#artifact:retracing-bolide) **and** [Wanderer's Troupe ](#artifact:wanderers-troupe)**/**[ Tenacity of the Millelith (2) ](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**+**[ Crimson's Witch of Flame (2)](#artifact:crimson-witch-of-flames): All these options are almost on equal footing because both of the sets have an equal overall damage output assuming you have 100% shield uptime when using Bolide (4). The difference is, you want to use 2/2 WT/CW when focusing on Nuking and better consistency, while 4 Bolide is for overall higher AA damage at the expense of lower burst damage, although inconsistent if you cannot keep your shield permanently.

**Regarding Artifact Substats Priority**

Since Hu Tao is able to trigger Vaporize on most of her damage output, Elemental Mastery is quite valuable on her. If you have less than 100EM total (including from Sucrose EM share, 4pc Instructor, etc) EM substat take priority over Crit Rate / DMG.


# === characters.#itto.roles.#dps.notes ===

Arataki Itto is a Geo DPS Character who takes advantage of his Elemental Burst's ATK boost and Geo infusion to deal significant damage during its uptime. His combos involve stacking and unleashing his Charged Attacks, named Arataki Kesagiri. Arataki Kesigiri consumes no stamina and can be casted continuously as long as he has Superlative Superstrength stacks. Superlative Superstrength is capped at 5 stacks at any given time, and Itto gets those stacks when his 2nd and 4th Normal Attack string hits an enemy. Activating his Elemental Burst allows his 1st and 3rd Normal Attack to also generate stacks.

Itto's Elemental Skill deals damage to enemies on cast and summons a taunt, Ushi, which is considered a Geo Construct. This initial cast damage grants Itto 1 Superlative Superstrength stack, and upon Ushi leaving the field, Itto is granted another stack. When Ushi takes damage, Itto gains a stack (capped at 1 stack per 2 seconds). Itto's Elemental Burst converts his Normal and Charged Attacks into Geo DMG, increases Itto's Normal Attack Speed and converts a portion of Itto's current DEF to ATK.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Serpent Spine](#weapon:serpent-spine)<br>
When [using Husk of Opulent Dreams](#artifact:husk-of-opulent-dreams), Serpent Spine stacks are prioritized over Husk of the Opulent Dreams stacks due to their conflicting nature in gaining stacks (Off-field and on-field).

[Skyward Pride](#weapon:skyward-pride)<br>
Can be a great or bad weapon for Itto depending on your ER needs. The less Energy Recharge you need (due to particle generation from your party members or ER from subs), the less useful this weapon becomes.

[Whiteblind](#weapon:whiteblind)<br>
Your rotations often start with 1 stack of this weapon, and due to Itto's Burst snapshotting DEF on cast, you're unable to take advantage of further DEF% from the stacks.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Retracting Bolide (4)](#artifact:retracing-bolide)<br>
Bolide grants you an additional 40% Normal and Charged Attack DMG when shielded. Crystallize can be unreliable so a consistent shielder is preferred, such as Zhongli.


# === characters.#jean.roles.#burst_support.notes ===

Jean's Elemental Skill can be used to fling smaller mobs into the air to deal fall damage, and to stagger bigger ones. **Her healing scales with ATK.**

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Amenoma Kageuchi](#weapon:amenoma-kageuchi)<br>
This weapon can lower your ER% requirements from anywhere between **\~150% to no additional ER% needed,** depending on the **number of stacks on the passive and the refinement of this weapon.** As such, at **higher refines / more stacks on the passive,** this weapon can perform **better than [Skyward Blade,](#weapon:skyward-blade)** while at **lower refines / less stacks, it can perform worse.**

[Freedom-Sworn](#weapon:freedom-sworn)<br>
The ranking here only **assumes Jean's personal damage and not the utility it gives.** If you want to furthermore buff your main DPS, you can give this sword to Jean as she **can trigger Freedom-Sworn's skill relatively easily since Anemo is always trigger.**

[Lion's Roar](#weapon:lions-roar)<br>
Depending on passive uptime, it can be ranked over [Favonius Sword](#weapon:favonius-sword) (at 50% uptime) and even [Aquila Favonia](#weapon:aquila-favonia) (at 100% uptime).

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Viridescent Venerer (4)](#artifact:viridescent-venerer)<br>
The bread and butter for Anemo characters in general, as it is **commonly used for the 40% elemental resistance shred.**

[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)<br>
Another option for **providing utilities to the team.** This set gives a **20% partywide ATK boost** after Jean casts her Elemental Burst.

[Ocean-Hued Clam (4)](#artifact:ocean-hued-clam)<br>
The best set for Jean's personal damage, as the damage it deals scales with Jean's burst healing. However, because Jean's total damage output is on the low end, it is generally recommended to prioritize utility options such as Noblesse Oblige or Viridescent Venerer over this set.

**Regarding Mainstat Choices**

Elemental Mastery should only be used **when Jean is paired with Bennett,** as her burst ticks will swirl the self applied Pyro from Bennett's burst, acting as a damage source and Pyro application. Because of this, high burst uptime is required and so weapons with EM and ER passives are preferred. ([Freedom Sworn](#weapon:freedom-sworn), [Skyward Blade](#weapon:skyward-blade), [Favonius Sword](#weapon:favonius-sword), [Sacrificial Sword](#weapon:sacrificial-sword), [Iron Sting](#weapon:iron-sting), [Amenoma Kageuchi](#weapon:amenoma-kageuchi))

**Regarding Talent Priorities**

If you prefer more damage than healing, prioritize Elemental Skill over Elemental Burst since it scales better.

For Support Jean, you can either go for more ATK for stronger heals, but relatively lower Burst uptime, or more ER for lower heals, but higher Burst uptime.

Choosing between these two is up to personal preference, although if another Anemo character is on the team, Jean has very little energy problem and can potentially go full Sub DPS build.


# === characters.#kaeya.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/kaeya/) from Kaeya Mains + KQM


# === characters.#kaeya.roles.#cryo_dps.subStats.notes ===

**crit-rate:** Generally has less value than the other offensive stats due to [Blizzard Strayer](#artifact:blizzard-strayer) and Cryo Resonance


# === characters.#kaeya.roles.#cryo_dps.talents.notes ===

If not paired with Chongyun, Skill takes priority over Normal Attacks


# === characters.#kaeya.roles.#cryo_dps.tips ===

**\[C1\]** against Cryo affected enemies


# === characters.#kaeya.roles.#cryo_dps.notes ===

Kaeya Cryo DPS is mostly used in a team with Chongyun and Xingqiu/Barbara while having Blizzard Strayer (4) equipped. In this team, Kaeya has 55% crit rate against Frozen enemies without any additional Crit stats, which means Crit Rate substats are generally prioritized less than ATK% or Crit DMG.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Pale Flame (4)](#artifact:pale-flame)<br>
This set is difficult to fully utilise due to Kaeya's skill cooldown being 6 seconds. The full set effect requires 2 stacks to be active at any given time, so maintaining stacks can be difficult when considering rotations between characters.


# === characters.#kaeya.roles.#burst_support.notes ===

Kaeya's Elemental Burst makes him an excellent source of Cryo application for characters that often stay in melee range, although his burst can't be fully utilized with Reverse Melt teams due to how his Cryo damage is split into a barrage of attacks.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Freedom Sworn](#weapon:freedom-sworn)<br>
This weapon's ranking is assumed with **Reverse Melt teams** where the EM stat would be useful.

[Skyward Blade](#weapon:skyward-blade)<br>
In teams with a **2nd Cryo unit generating energy,** this weapon would have a lower priority as the Energy Recharge stat would mostly be wasted.

[Lion's Roar ](#weapon:lions-roar)**/**[ The Alley Flash](#weapon:the-alley-flash) / [Iron Sting](#weapon:iron-sting)<br>
These weapons' rankings are assumed with **Reverse Melt teams** where the passive and EM stat would be useful. At **\[R5\],** these weapons would **outperform Summit Shaper.**

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Instructor (4)](#artifact:instructor)<br>
Due to his ability to easily trigger Instructor's passive, Kaeya is a good holder of **Instructor (4)** for Reverse Melt teams. Aside from ER%, most of his other main stats don't matter as much, making this one of his budget support builds.

[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)<br>
This set is only recommended if there is no other member of the team running Noblesse Oblige (4).


# === characters.#kazuha.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/kazuha/) from KQM


# === characters.#kazuha.roles.#em_build.tips ===

The element which is absorbed by Kazuha's elemental burst follows the priority of Pyro > Hydro > Electro > Cryo, and can be absorbed from both the active character and enemies. **(i.e. Standing in Bennett 's Elemental Burst will result in Kazuha's Elemental Burst infusing Pyro as Bennett's Elemental Burst applies Pyro to the active character)**


# === characters.#kazuha.roles.#em_build.notes ===

Kazuha's 4th Ascension Passive encourages players to maximise Elemental Mastery in order to maximise his utility.

**Similar to Venti, due to the EM buffs, a triple EM build will out-damage a regular ATK-EM/Anemo/Crit build as long as there are 2+ enemies due to the amount of swirls involved. Because of this, an ADC (Attack/Damage/Crit) build isn't recommended unless he is in a team whereby he cannot make use of his A4 passive or swirls. (i.e. mono Anemo/Geo teams)**

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

The ultimate goal is to try **stack as much EM while getting enough ER (160-180%) for a consistent Burst uptime.** Having Sacrificial Sword or a second Anemo character in the team will also help reduce the needs for ER and prioritize EM substats more.

[Iron Sting](#weapon:iron-sting)<br>
Iron Sting will yield the highest upfront EM and teamwide buff if compared to the other 4 star options, **if you manage to meet his energy needs or simply don't need more than one rotation, this would be the better option if compared to the Energy Recharge weapons.**

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Thundering Fury (4)](#artifact:thundering-fury)<br>
This is a niche build that excels **only in AOE situations and with specific teams.** This teams includes an **off-field Hydro and Electro support to allow Kazuha to constantly trigger the 4p effect and spam his Elemental Skill, aswell as another Anemo support to hold the 4p Viridiscent Venerer set.** Such teams can be **Kazuha + Kokomi + Fischl + Venti,** with **Barbara and Sucrose** being weaker replacements for Kokomi and Venti. This team triggers **multiple fall damage instances against enemies that can be Crowd Controlled by Kazuha.** Fischl can use The Viridiscent Hunt bow to allow for more fall damage instances. **\*\*NOTE: This team performs very poorly in pure single target situations.**


# === characters.#keqing.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/keqing/) from KQM


# === characters.#keqing.roles.#physical_dps.talents.notes ===

Refer to Notes below


# === characters.#keqing.roles.#physical_dps.notes ===

This section is dedicated to a playstyle where Keqing does not infuse her attacks with electro, and instead focuses on physical damage (white numbers). For this reason, you should be charged attacking after casting Stellar Restoration (E) instead of recasting it.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Pale Flame (4)](#artifact:pale-flame)**<br>
This set is the best by far as Keqing can proc its 4 piece set bonus instantly by charge attacking after casting E.

**[Pale Flame (2) ](#artifact:pale-flame)+ [Bloodstained Chivalry (2)](#artifact:bloodstained-chivalry)**<br>
This set should only be used until getting 4PF.

**[Bloodstained Chivalry (2) ](#artifact:bloodstained-chivalry)+ [18% ATK set (2)](#artifact:18%-atk)**<br>
The generalist Physical DPS set.

**[Retracing Bolide (4)](#artifact:retracing-bolide)**<br>
This set should only be used with a consistent shielder (i.e. Zhongli/Diona) for obvious reasons.

**[Bloodstained Chivalry (4)](#artifact:bloodstained-chivalry)**<br>
This set is for general solo and Abyss content where there are multiple mobs that can be killed with charged attacks within 10 seconds, this is for dealing with a crowd, in other words, AoE. I**t is not recommended because of the kill condition.**


# === characters.#keqing.roles.#electro_dps.artifacts.notes ===

4-pcs. Thundering Fury is Not Recommended for Electro DPS Keqing.

Note: Artifact recommendations are not ranked in order of recommendation, read the notes for more info.


# === characters.#keqing.roles.#electro_dps.talents.notes ===

Note: Since Keqing uses burst to get an extra 15% crit, it's much better in leveling it.  Best course of action is to level NA and Burst together. Don't forget to level skill to a decent level.


# === characters.#keqing.roles.#electro_dps.tips ===

**Preferred Skill Combo**

ES (Place stiletto, don't reactivate yet) -> EB -> ES (Reactivation) -> Spam AA -> Repeat

**Regarding Roles**

Both physical and electro keqing are good and viable. You'd usually want to decide which build to go for depending on your weapon gacha luck. For example, Lion's Roar = Electro, Flute will be equally good on Electro/Phys, etc.


# === characters.#keqing.roles.#electro_dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Summit Shaper](#weapon:summit-shaper)**<br>
This weapon can only beat Jade Cutter **\[R1\]** when it's shielded at **\[R2\].**

**[The Black Sword](#weapon:the-black-sword)**<br>
On a quickswap Keqing, this weapon will be shifted below Harbinger of Dawn **\[R5\].**

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Thundering Fury (2) ](#artifact:thundering-fury)+ [18% ATK set (2)](#artifact:18%-atk)**<br>
This set is a generalist set, which means it can be used generally anywhere, whether it be Co-op or Abyss, or other singleplayer content. This has a lot of consistency due to its independence from electro aura, and it is more viable in abyss.

**[Thundersoother (4)](#artifact:thundersoother)**<br>
This set should be used with Electro-charged team compositions (Keqing + Xingqiu) or mono-electro team comp (Not Suggested). This set has a 35% Dmg modifier which increases all damage from all sources, although that modifier is a bit unstable due to its dependency to the sustainability of Electro aura on enemies.

**[Thundering Fury (2) ](#artifact:thundering-fury)+ [Noblesse Oblige (2)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**<br>
This set is used for Burst/Quickswap AoE Keqing. With this set, you'd want to be using Starward Sword (Q) all the time, which is your main source of DPS with this set.


# === characters.#klee.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/klee/) from Klee Mains + KQM


# === characters.#klee.roles.#dps.tips ===

Klee's Attacks have a 50% chance of spawning a floating star. Floating star removes the stamina cost for the next Charged Attack and increases 50% of its damage.


# === characters.#klee.roles.#dps.notes ===

Extremely squishy, Klee requires great positioning. Being tiny, this is hard to achieve. Constant jumping during your Charged Attacks can help.

**Regarding Weapon Choice**

[Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds](#weapon:lost-prayer-to-the-sacred-winds)<br>
Bennett buff/ Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer's buff + Noblesse Oblige (4) will push Lost Prayer ahead of Skyward Atlas and Memory of Dust

[Dodoco Tales](#weapon:dodoco-tales)<br>
On equal refinements, Widsith and Solar Pearl are better than Dodoco Tales, but when assuming \[R5\] Dodoco Tales vs \[R1\]-\[R3\] Widsith/Pearl, Dodoco Tales is better. **Note that Bennett buff / Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer's buff + Noblesse Oblige (4) buff may push Widsith and Solar Pearl above Dodoco Tales, even at low refinements.**

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Lavawalker (4)](#artifact:lavawalker)<br>
Klee's kit makes it harder to utilize Vaporize and Melt the same way another pyro carry would, but her constant pyro application makes Lavawalkers a viable set. See KleefulFrame's great [number breakdown here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JJZPMoNOqXhX8Ez1cl63fNXESJZXx7kQaJEeQ-WLOEY/edit#gid=186983353)

[Crimson Witch of Flames (4)](#artifact:crimson-witch-of-flames)<br>
This set is best used on a Vaporize Klee, but do note that due to Klee's fast Pyro application from all of her kits, she may not be able to vape most of her Normal/ Charged Attacks.

[Wanderer's Troupe (4)](#artifact:wanderers-troupe)<br>
Wanderer's Troupe increases the Charged Attack by another 35% Damage Bonus. It can serve as a decent DPS choice but due to how clunky Klee's attack animations are, it's hard to put this in actual practise as it requires you to dodge more and consume more stamina, not to mention how the DPS gets caught up by the other builds mentioned above.

Kokomi's Elemental Burst dynamically alters her skill's damage, this means that you cannot use her Burst to snapshot the buff onto the Skill and swap out.<br>


# === characters.#kokomi.roles.#support.notes ===

Support Kokomi focuses on just using her Elemental Burst before her Elemental Skill's duration ends to refresh her skill duration. This allows 100% uptime on Hydro application from her Elemental Skill for Freeze / Electro-charge teams.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Hakushin Ring](#weapon:hakushin-ring)<br>
This weapon can provide Elemental DMG% for the team in **Electro-charged teams** and will outperform Prototype Amber if you value damage more than healing.

[Sacrificial Fragments](#weapon:sacrificial-fragments)<br>
Can be useful as Kokomi won't need to use her Elemental Burst to reset her skill duration. This **allows for smoother rotations** as she will not face the problem of missing out on the reset for her Elemental Skill due to not casting Burst in time.

**Regarding Artifact Choices**

[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)<br>
With proper extension of Kokomi's Elemental Skill, she can maintain near **100% uptime on this artifact set's 4 piece effect.**

[Ocean Hued Clam (4)](#artifact:ocean-hued-clam)<br>
This ranking assumes Kokomi is being used **only for her Elemental Skill.** If she is being used to attack onfield during Elemental Burst, this set may **overtake Tenacity of the Millelith (4).**

**Regarding Main Stats and Sub Stats**

**Energy Recharge**<br>
Prioritise Energy Recharge first to ensure you can always use Elemental Burst before the Elemental Skill expires in order to maintain Hydro application. **Without Prototype Amber, Kokomi will need \~200-220%+ Energy Recharge (170-190% with Prototype Amber at \[R1\] and 150-170% at \[R5\])**

**Hydro DMG**<br>
This can be used to sacrifice some of Kokomi's healing to boost her damage if she is attacking onfield during Elemental Burst.


# === characters.#kokomi.roles.#dps.tips ===

Due to Kokomi's high stamina cost on her Charged Attacks, her best attack strings are:

At **\[C0\]:** N2D<br>
At **\[C1\]:** N3D

\*NA = Normal Attack, D = Dash

N3D might result in a loss of Beidou Stormbreaker hits (DPS loss), and as such is only recommended in a Vaporize comp where the added Hydro application is favoured.


# === characters.#kokomi.roles.#dps.notes ===

DPS Kokomi aims to maximise her onfield damage during her Elemental Burst's duration. Outside of her Elemental Burst, her damage is lackluster and not worth building for.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers](#weapon:thrilling-tales-of-dragon-slayers)**<br>
Although this weapon doesn't provide as much personal damage for Kokomi, the 48% ATK buff is usually more worth in most cases. **This can be her best weapon in for overall team DPS if you don't already have another TTDS user in your team.**

**[Hakushin Ring](#weapon:hakushin-ring)**<br>
This weapon can provide Elemental DMG% for the team in Electro-charged teams, and will usually be the best choice in those situations.

**Regarding Artifact Choices**

**[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
Although this set offers the lowest personal dmg for Kokomi, the 20% ATK team buff can sometimes be better for overall team DPS.


# === characters.#kujou-sara.roles.#burst_support.subStats.notes ===

Prioritize Energy Recharge first if you can't burst off cooldown


# === characters.#kujou-sara.roles.#burst_support.tips ===

For her Elemental Skill to generate particles, you need to perform a Charged Shot to place a Crowfeather after casting her Elemental Skill. If the Crowfeather explosion hits an enemy, it generates 3 particles.

Crowfeathers generated from Sara's \[C2\] do NOT generate particles.


# === characters.#kujou-sara.roles.#burst_support.notes ===

Sara is a quickswap support who is able to buff your active characters via its Crowfeather mechanics. When Sara uses her Elemental Skill, her next Charged Shot will leave a Crowfeather on the target location and after a short while, the Crowfeather explodes and **the active character in its AoE will benefit from Sara's ATK buff, which scales with her Base ATK.**

At \[C2\], you can skip the Charged Shot as it immediately drops a Crowfeather, and save it for later on if you wanna swap back to her to extend her buffs. You can also use Elemental Skill followed by Elemental Burst so that she benefits from the Crowfeather dropped by her Elemental Skill, then swap to other character so that character can benefit from Sara's ATK buff. It's worth mentioning that Sara's Crit DMG buff at \[C6\] doesn't snapshot and it also doesn't show on the stats page, so don't freak out when you don't see it there.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

Weapons here are **ranked based on their Base ATK** to maximize Sara's ATK buff.

**[Elegy for the End](#weapon:elegy-for-the-end)**<br>
The cooldown on this weapon's passive aligns perfectly with Sara's Elemental Burst cooldown. This weapon has lower base ATK if compared with Skyward Harp, but this weapon can be considered over Skyward Harp since Sara is able to trigger the weapon passive quite easily with her Elemental Burst to provide your party members with another 100 EM and 20% ATK buff for 12 seconds, it also has Energy Recharge substat which is very valuable on a Burst Support Sara.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**<br>
Universal support set that is able to buff your party member's ATK by 20%, use this set on Sara if there's nobody else in the party who's equipping one.


# === characters.#lisa.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/lisa/)  from  Lisa Mains + KQM


# === characters.#lisa.roles.#electro_dps.tips ===

**Optimal Lisa String**

ES (Tap) > NA x2 \[until 3 stacks\] > Fully-charged ES (Hold) > N2C. Repeat N2C until E is off-cooldown, then repeat the string.

**\*N/NA = Normal attack, C = Charged attack, ES = Elemental Skill**


# === characters.#lisa.roles.#electro_dps.notes ===

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Thundersoother (4)](#artifact:thundersoother)**<br>
For teams that focus on Electro-Charge reactions, **Thundersoother (4)** can out dps **Thundering Fury (2) +18% ATK set (2),** said set is only recommended below **Thundering Fury (2) +18% ATK set (2)** due to the potential inconsistency.

Electro DPS Lisa plays around Electro-Charge reaction teams ideally, for Overload Lisa teams, you would be building for EM DPS since you can be the consistent trigger with supports that apply constant Pyro off-field. You can still have an Overload team with an Electro DPS Lisa, however, if the situation prefers it.

**Regarding Weapons**

**[Kagura's Verity](#weapon:kaguras-verity)**<br>
Kagura's ranking at the top is based on executing the specific rotation of Tap E > N2 > Tap E > N2 > Tap E > Q > N1 > Hold E > N1 > CA > N3 > N2 > CA for max stacks. For more details please see the [weapon calculations here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kBaIxbNUUkShl-OwbOxMK4wyPQvL-WWeOko7yfWRIxw/edit#gid=0).


# === characters.#lisa.roles.#em_dps.talents.notes ===

EM DPS Lisa's Talent Levels are not a necessity


# === characters.#lisa.roles.#em_dps.notes ===

EM Lisa DPS aims to be the consistent trigger for reactions, Overload is generally the best reaction for this set up. Avoid having a second Electro in the team for this build since this could mess up the Pyro aura Lisa wants for this playstyle.

Electro-Charge teams will have a hard time trying to utilize EM DPS Lisa, in these situations, build Electro DPS or Off-Field DPS Lisa instead.

**Regarding Stats Priority**

Try to invest both into EM and ER. The goal is to try stack as much EM while getting enough ER (170-190%) for a comfortable Burst uptime depending on your teams.


# === characters.#lisa.roles.#off-field_dps.tips ===

Lisa's Hold cast does not require 4 full seconds of charging to reach maximum damage threshold, as long as the indicator aligns with ring, you can release your cast at max damage.


# === characters.#lisa.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

Can be built to set up for either Burst damage or Quickswap Skill Nuke damage.<br>
Lisa works well with anemo characters which can keep enemies in her ultimate radius.

**Regarding Weapon Choice**

**[Kagura's Verity](#weapon:kaguras-verity)**<br>
Ranking is based on executing a specific rotation: Tap E > N2 > Tap E > Q > Hold E (3 Stack).

**[Thrilling Tales Of Dragon Slayers](#weapon:thrilling-tales-of-dragon-slayers)**<br>
This option is **only recommended on a low investment Lisa** whereby she is focused around buffing her teammates and contributing team DPS over outputting high damage on her own.

**Regarding Stats Priority**

These options prioritize Lisa's Elemental Burst uptime as a defense shredding tool.


# === characters.#mona.roles.#dps.tips ===

<br>


# === characters.#mona.roles.#dps.notes ===

This build is best utilised at **\[C2\],** but can work without it. Do note that several 4 stars will out-dps Mona, as **Mona is better off as a Sub-DPS/ Support.**


# === characters.#mona.roles.#nuke.tips ===

To make Mona's burst damage trigger the Vaporize 2.0x multiplier:<br>
1. Apply Pyro on enemy<br>
2. Cast Burst (should react and remove Pyro status on the enemy after using Burst)<br>
3. Wait 2.5 seconds for Mona's burst ICD (Mona should stay on field if you have Bennett, to keep the buff)<br>
4. Swap to Pyro character and apply Pyro on enemy<br>
5. Burst will pop after enemy gets hit, applying Hydro and vaporising her damage.


# === characters.#mona.roles.#nuke.notes ===

Mona's **Elemental Skill provides taunt** and procs wet status on enemies, her **Elemental Burst is also capable of rendering smaller enemies immobile** (Mona needs to be at least 20 levels within the enemy's level) and **providing a huge damage burst** (and additional omen debuff after proc).

**Look to the Nuke Mona's Ability Tip section for Vaporize Nuke set up instructions.**


# === characters.#mona.roles.#freeze_support.mainStats.notes ===

Offensive stats aren't actually needed on a Freeze Support Mona, focus on Artifact Set Bonus


# === characters.#mona.roles.#freeze_support.subStats.notes ===

Offensive stats aren't needed, just stack ER for comfortable Elemental Burst uptime


# === characters.#mona.roles.#freeze_support.tips ===

Mona's Burst applies bubble and Omen debuff upon cast, the count down timer only begins when the bubble is broken.

Frozen enemies can have their bubbles preserved as long as enemies stay in a frozen state. This technique makes Mona a priority Support for Freeze DPS teams.


# === characters.#mona.roles.#freeze_support.notes ===

Mona's main role on a freeze team is to **provide Omen debuff** from her burst as **it is extendable via Freeze mechanics.** Note that you must **apply Cryo before casting Mona's Elemental Burst** for the extension to happen. Omen Freeze extension can be done by **reapplying Cryo and Hydro aura consistently** (this can be done with Cryo/ Hydro infused Venti Elemental Burst + on-field Cryo/ Hydro aura).

**Regarding Artifact Sets**<br>

**[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
Run this set if there's already another character with [Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige) on the team.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers](#weapon:thrilling-tales-of-dragon-slayers)<br>
Generally the best option on Freeze Support Mona because she can furthermore buff the ATK of your Main DPS. This however comes with an assumption that with TTDS, you still have 100% Elemental Burst uptime. If you do not, pick the other Energy Recharge weapon options for more Elemental Burst uptime.


# === characters.#ningguang.roles.#dps.tips ===

Ningguang's Elemental Skill has a 6 second internal cooldown on generating energy, so for the sake of maintaining Elemental Burst uptime, wait 6 seconds to cast again if you need energy. It also breaks when casted on top of another Geo Structure, you can intentionally use a structure to break your first screen.


# === characters.#ningguang.roles.#dps.notes ===

Due to Ningguang having a really low Base ATK and no ATK conversion mechanics, external ATK buffers such as Bennett is recommended as a support for Ningguang to bump up her ATK stat.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

With external ATK buffs assumed.

[Lost Prayers to the Sacred Winds](#weapon:lost-prayer-to-the-sacred-winds)<br>
A really good weapon with external ATK buffs considered due to having Crit Rate main stat. Even with 1 stack of passive, this weapon is highly competitive with the other top choices.

[Memory of Dust](#weapon:memory-of-dust)<br>
A really good ATK stat stick which performs better than the other 5 star options if you don't consider external ATK buffers like Bennett, Pyro resonance, etc, but falls off with it considered.

[The Widsith](#weapon:the-widsith)<br>
A bursty weapon which has a really great passive, however Ningguang can only benefit from 2 out of the 3 passives that this weapon provides; EM bonus on Ningguang is basically useless.

[Dodoco Tales](#weapon:dodoco-tales)<br>
Being an ATK weapon, it falls off if compared to the other 4 star options such as Solar Pearl and The Widsith with external ATK buffs considered, but can perform better without it considered.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Retracing Bolide (4)](#artifact:retracing-bolide)<br>
Bolide grants you an additional 40% Normal and Charged Attack DMG when shielded. Crystallize can be unreliable so a consistent shielder is preferred, such as Zhongli.


# === characters.#ningguang.roles.#burst_support.tips ===

Walk through the Jade Screen created from Ningguang's Elemental Skill before casting Elemental Burst to benefit from the Geo DMG% bonus provided from her A4 Talent.


# === characters.#ningguang.roles.#burst_support.notes ===

A Burst Support Ningguang is basically a quickswap DPS Ningguang, you don't do Normal Attacks & Charged Attacks as much, so your main source of damage comes from your Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

With external ATK buffs assumed.

[Lost Prayers to the Sacred Winds](#weapon:lost-prayer-to-the-sacred-winds)<br>
Falls off a bit if compared to Skyward Atlas due to not being able to stack the passive reliably, but it's still a Crit weapon which makes stat building much easier.

[Memory of Dust](#weapon:memory-of-dust)<br>
A really good ATK statstick which can perform better than the other options if you don't consider external ATK buffers like Bennett, Pyro resonance, etc, but falls off with it considered.

[Solar Pearl](#weapon:solar-pearl)<br>
Due to Solar Pearl's passive being able to buff quite a huge percentage of a quickswap Ningguang's damage (Elemental Burst Damage), with external ATK buffs it performs similarly to Memory of Dust.


# === characters.#noelle.roles.#dps.weapons.notes ===

\[C6\] is assumed for this ranking.


# === characters.#noelle.roles.#dps.mainStats.notes ===

ATK% sands when below C6 and below Talent Level 9 Burst.


# === characters.#noelle.roles.#dps.subStats.advices.1.notes ===

\~20-30%


# === characters.#noelle.roles.#dps.tips ===

Optimal attack rotation is **N1>N2>N3>N4>dash/hop,** where N refers to each normal attack in her 4 hit combo. This isn't always feasible due to cast time and N4 covers a lesser AoE than N1-3 (as well as knockback issues), so the recommended rotation is **N1>N2>N3>dash/hop.**


# === characters.#noelle.roles.#dps.notes ===

**It's recommended to avoid building a DPS Noelle if she's not \[C5+\].**<br>
Noelle DPS is best optimized at **\[C6\]** where she converts an additional 50% DEF into ATK. Her ability to sustain her team with shields, heals and AOE damage makes for a reliable DPS when your team is built around her.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Serpent Spine](#weapon:serpent-spine)<br>
When using Husk of Opulent Dreams, Serpent Spine stacks are prioritized over Husk of the Opulent Dreams stacks, due to their conflicting nature in gaining stacks (Off-field and on-field)

[Skyward Pride](#weapon:skyward-pride)<br>
Useful if you are unable to get ER from your substats. Does really well while its passive is active, but falls off in sustained fights. Comfort option that has quite a big power gap if compared with Serpent Spine or Whiteblind.

[Favonius Greatsword](#weapon:favonius-greatsword)<br>
Only recommended with high refines, as its usefulness scales with its particle generation capabilities. R5 allows her to self-battery assuming some additional particles from enemies, but a second Geo is always recommended regardless for resonance.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Husk of Opulent Dreams (4)](#artifact:husk-of-opulent-dreams)<br>
Noelle snapshots her DEF on burst cast. To get the full 4 stacks' DEF% boost during your first burst, you need to wait 12 seconds off field before swapping in. In abyss, time spent before the chamber starts still generates stacks.

[Retracing Bolide (4)](#artifact:retracing-bolide)<br>
Optimally offers slightly less damage than Gladiator's, but is much easier to farm per resin and can have 100% uptime with crystallise shields. Consider Gladiator's Finale if you don't want to farm for [Archaic Petra](#artifact:archaic-petra) as Artifact Strongbox is much more effective than elite bosses in terms of artifacts per resin.


# === characters.#noelle.roles.#support.artifacts.notes ===

Ideally just run with whatever DEF% main stats you have. Set bonuses are not important, focus on stacking DEF.


# === characters.#noelle.roles.#support.tips ===

Use her charged attacks for healing as they are much faster than normal attacks.


# === characters.#noelle.roles.#support.notes ===

Support Noelle is not currently recommended in any content due to her extremely lackluster healing and poor shield uptime.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Sacrificial Greatsword](#weapon:sacrificial-greatsword)<br>
Does not proc on Noelle's **\[C4\]** if she's off field, so a high refine is needed for the initial cast to reliably reset cooldown. Even with **\[R5\],** the cooldown is 16 seconds while Noelle's shield duration is 12, so forced downtime is an issue.

[Favonius Greatsword](#weapon:favonius-greatsword)<br>
Relies on hitting crits to generate energy. The 12 second cooldown at **\[R1\]** matches with her shield cooldown. Generally not recommended unless you have an abundance of crit substats or wish to build her pseudo-DPS.


# === characters.#qiqi.roles.#support.notes ===

Qiqi's Burst has an 80 energy cost with her skill not generating any energy until **\[C1\].** Energy Recharge will greatly benefit Qiqi, while her Burst should be kept as a last resort.<br>
Qiqi's Burst allows other characters to maximize DPS field time while offering healing from being off-field. At Ascension 4, her Normal Attack applies the healing talisman onto an enemy with a cooldown of 30 seconds.

**Regarding Weapon and Artifact Choices**

[Sacrificial Sword](#weapon:sacrificial-sword) and [Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)<br>
Tenacity of the Millelith allows Qiqi to give the team a **decent ATK boost** while staying in enemy melee reach with Skill active. Sacrificial Sword increases the uptime of her Skill, which in turn increases the uptime of the team's ATK boost. If you find that your Qiqi's heals are often more than enough, you may consider switching her to this artifact set. **Do note that other characters might utilize Sacrificial Sword more than Qiqi, such as Xingqiu, Kazuha, etc.**

[Ocean Hued Clam (4)](#artifact:ocean-hued-clam)<br>
This ranking assumes **Qiqi does not get her Elemental Burst up often** and is instead relying mainly on her Elemental Skill for healing. If she is in a team which **funds her enough energy particles,** or if she acts as the **on-field DPS,** this set can **overtake Tenacity of the Millelith (4).**


# === characters.#raiden-shogun.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/raiden/) from Raiden Mains + KQM


# === characters.#raiden-shogun.roles.#electro_dps.tips ===

Start your rotation with Raiden's Elemental Skill to amplify your party member's Elemental Burst damage.

Burst combo:<br>
- Skill > Burst > 4NA + CA (2 times) > 2NA + CA **(Recommended)**<br>
- Skill > Burst > 3NA + CA (3 times) > 1NA + CA **(Optimal)**

**\*NA = Normal Attack, CA = Charged Attack**

The recommended combo provides more room for error and offers slightly better AoE while the optimal combo provides slightly higher damage.


# === characters.#raiden-shogun.roles.#electro_dps.notes ===

Raiden's Elemental Burst damage depends on her **team's energy consumption prior to her Burst,** and her Burst **restores a comfortable amount of energy for her team** (which is further amplified by her passive). This is especially convenient on teams that doesn't conflict with her element and wants the energy provision. (IE Eula, Electro, National teams, etc.). Raiden has no issues with firing her ult off cooldown after reaching about 200% Energy Recharge, but it is possible to raise it higher for better energy restoration for her team.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**This list assumes that Raiden is not ran with an external buffer.**

**[Wavebreaker's Fin](#weapon:wavebreakers-fin)**<br>
\[R5\] Wavebreaker's Fin is relatively equal Staff of Homa, depending on your total team burst cost.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
This set acts as a low investment support oriented set. Raiden is an excellent ToTM holder since her Elemental Skill has 100% uptime and procs very easily. Do note that if your Raiden is equipping this set, then she will sacrifice her personal damage.

**Regarding Main Stats**

**Raiden's main stat priority for Sands and Goblet entirely depends on the substats, whether she has external buffs, and which weapon she is running.** You can find a more detailed list of [suggestions from ZΛNTO#4984's mastersheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VdRUAKFUoKkceIghV5tCfr3kfoiH59mcFOMorI9jYrw/edit#gid=1372936118) or run it on a calculator/optimizer.


# === characters.#razor.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/razor/) from Razor Mains + KQM


# === characters.#razor.roles.#dps.tips ===

Razor's EB grants you an Electro Status when you basic attack while burst is in-effect, that means it can be used for status-cleansing (no particular effective element).  Can only be done on himself.<br>


# === characters.#razor.roles.#dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Wolf's Gravestone](#weapon:wolfs-gravestone)**<br>
Wolf's Gravestone (inactive) outperforms Skyward Pride in every scenario except crowd battles.

**[Redhorn Stonethresher](#weapon:redhorn-stonethresher)**<br>
Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you're getting, this weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in personal damage.

**[The Unforged](#weapon:the-unforged)**<br>
The playstyle with this weapon becomes a lot more comfortable without having to worry about snapshotting Wolf's Gravestone / Song of Broken Pines buffs for Sub DPSes, while also granting more Shield Bonus for better Shield uptime. A shielder is required for this, with Zhongli being the most ideal option.

**[Serpent Spine](#weapon:serpent-spine)**<br>
At **\[C6\]** and high refinement Serpent Spine, it is better to run an ATK% Goblet over Physical Damage% with Serpent Spine. This is due to the oversaturation of damage bonuses (ascension stat + Serpent Spine) in addition to the fact that Electro accounts for a significant portion of Razor's damage. An in-depth explanation [can be found here](https://tinyurl.com/razoratk). **It is also worth noting that an \[R5\] Serpent Spine with max stacks can outperform all 5✩ weapons at \[R1\].**

**[Skyward Pride](#weapon:skyward-pride)**<br>
Skyward Pride is viable with a Physical DMG goblet, as the damage dealt through its passive scales with Physical%.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Pale Flame (2) ](#artifact:pale-flame)+ [Bloodstained Chivalry (2)](#artifact:bloodstained-chivalry)**<br>
This set is better if your ATK% is covered by your substats, otherwise you would be better off running Gladiator's Finale (4). **This is only recommended to those who have no immediate access to a decent Pale Flame (4) set, otherwise you would be better off investing on Pale Flame pieces, regardless of weapon choice.**


# === characters.#rosaria.roles.#cryo_dps.notes ===

**Regarding Substats**

Rosaria does not need much Energy Recharge if paired with Kaeya. If paired with another Cryo unit such as Chongyun or Ayaka, she will need \~130-150% Energy Recharge.

Compared to Kaeya, Rosaria has even less desire for Crit Rate, as her Ascension 1 Talent includes an extra 12% Crit Rate once skill hits the back of an enemy.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Wavebreaker's Fin](#weapon:wavebreakers-fin)<br>
At **\[R5\],** this weapon can perform similar to **Staff of Homa.**

[Deathmatch](#weapon:deathmatch)<br>
Rosaria gets alot of Crit rate from **Blizzard Strayer (4) and Cryo Resonance.** As a result, this weapon falls off in value as you will tend to **overcap above 100% Crit rate.** If Rosaria is being used without the Blizzard Strayer (4) set, then this weapon can perform better compared to other options.

**Regarding Talent Priority**

**Normal Attack**<br>
If Rosaria is being used with **Chongyun to infuse her normal attacks with Cryo,** her Normal Attack talent will have **higher priority than Skill.**


# === characters.#rosaria.roles.#burst_support.tips ===

Be sure to cast skill before burst as Crit Rate granted by the Ascension 1 Talent will be included with Ascension 4 Talent Bonus as well.

Rosaria's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst can be Reverse Melted (1.5x) with another Pyro applier for some quick and powerful damage.


# === characters.#rosaria.roles.#burst_support.notes ===

This section is tailored around giving Rosaria as much damage as possible. Crit Rate stacking is not as necessary, if 50% Crit Rate is guaranteed at the very least, you will still be giving crit rate buffs of 9.7% with the Ascension 1 Talent Bonus.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

This section was calculated with **160% ER requirement,** which is why ER substats weapons are valued highly here, with lower ER reqs, those weapons may fall off if compared with weapons with more offensive substats. Rosaria's **\[C4\]** can reduce this ER requirement down to 140% or lower.

**[Vortex Vanquisher](#weapon:vortex-vanquisher)**<br>
This ranking is assumed without a shield. **With a large amount of attack buffs such as Bennett, this weapon can fall off compared to the other options due to overstacking ATK%.**

**[Dragon's Bane](#weapon:dragons-bane) / [Kitain Cross Spear](#weapon:kitain-cross-spear)**<br>
These weapons are only used if Rosaria is played in a team comp in which she constantly triggers Reverse Melt. \[R5\] Dragon's Bane can outperform ["The Catch"](#weapon:the-catch), and \[R5\] Kitain's Cross Spear is on par with Deathmatch.

**[Wavebreaker's Fin](#weapon:wavebreakers-fin)**<br>
At **\[R5\],** this weapon can perform **similar to Staff of Homa.**

**[Lithic Spear](#weapon:lithic-spear)**<br>
At **\[R5\],** this weapon can perform similar to [Vortex Vanquisher](#weapon:vortex-vanquisher).

**[Favonius Lance](#weapon:favonius-lance)**<br>
Although this weapon's damage is lower for Rosaria, the extra energy generated from the passive can be very valuable in alot of teams that need a Cryo battery (Eula, Ayaka, etc).

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Lavawalker's Epiphany (4)](#artifact:lavawalker)<br>
Only viable on Rosaria if she's triggering Reverse Melt, pulls ahead of Noblesse Oblige (2) Blizzard Strayer (2) assuming you can trigger Reverse Melt on all of her kits.

[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)<br>
 Offers party-wide ATK boost, you can equip this set on Rosaria if nobody else on the team is equipping it.

**Regarding Substats Priority**<br>
Elemental Mastery is only recommended if Rosaria is to be utilized as a Reverse Melt trigger, as shown in the Ability Tips section.

**The following is only recommended to those who have not obtained a desirable set for Rosaria, with Crit Rate building as her placeholder set.**<br>
If you don't wish to hyperinvest onto Rosaria, she could still be used as a Crit Rate provider, you can build up to 88% Crit Rate and use skill to cap out 100% Crit Rate, then cast Elemental Burst for the Crit Rate buff. This can be easily achievable if you have an existing Crit Rate substat polearm, otherwise just put on whatever Crit Rate Circlet, Substats and Berserker artifacts you may have to stack Crit Rate.


# === characters.#sayu.roles.#support.tips ===

Use hold Skill then immediately press it to generate more particles.


# === characters.#sayu.roles.#support.notes ===

Sayu does more damage with EM builds and heals more with ATK hybrid builds, Healing Bonus hat can be used for better heals while maintaining respectable damage. Note that Sayu wants a large amount of energy recharge when used as the only anemo slot on the team (200%ish).

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Wolf's Gravestone](#weapon:wolfs-gravestone)<br>
Wolf's Gravestone is a universal claymore that is capable of buffing your teammates along with providing more healing in Sayu's case. It is best used once you achieve your ER threshold.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Viridescent Venerer](#artifact:viridescent-venerer)<br>
The bread and butter artifact set for Anemo units, this set provides the ability to shred the enemy's elemental resistance while also buffing Sayu's swirl damage output.


# === characters.#shenhe.roles.#support.notes ===

Shenhe is a Support for Cryo characters, capable of providing damage buffs from her Elemental Skill and dealing damage while providing Cryo and Physical resistance shred from her Elemental Burst. Her **Elemental Skill gives a few stacks of additional flat damage bonus to all nearby party members (5 stacks on Tap and 7 stacks on Hold).** This additional flat damage bonus **only works on Cryo attacks,** so characters who doesn't deal Cryo attacks doesn't benefit from Shenhe's Elemental Skill, do note that **Cryo infusion from Anemo characters does act as a Cryo attack, so it benefits from Shenhe's Elemental Skill.** Another thing to note is that **the additional flat damage bonus Shenhe provides uses Shenhe's current ATK, so it doesn't snapshot.**

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Calamity Queller](#weapon:calamity-queller)<br>
The passive of this weapon works perfectly with Shenhe's Elemental Skill because it's dynamic. This weapon also has high Base ATK which makes ATK% substats really effective.

[Engulfing Lightning](#weapon:engulfing-lightning)<br>
This weapon provides Energy Recharge and converts Energy Recharge to ATK, which benefits Shenhe a lot.

[Vortex Vanquisher](#weapon:vortex-vanquisher)<br>
This weapon's passive can't be stacked off-field, but it's still an ATK stat stick which provides Shenhe with a lot of ATK.

[Favonius Lance](#weapon:favonius-lance)<br>
With this weapon, it is better to have some Crit Rate on Shenhe for the weapon passive to proc. (Do note that Cryo Resonance provides 15% Crit Rate on Cryo-imbued enemies, so the need for Crit Rate on Shenhe is lowered)

**Regarding Main Stats Priority**

If you're equipping an ATK% weapon, try to aim for an Energy Recharge sands and vice versa.


# === characters.#sucrose.roles.#em_build.talents.notes ===

Sucrose's Talent Levels are not a necessity.


# === characters.#sucrose.roles.#em_build.tips ===

When utilized as a [Viridescent Venerer (4)](#artifact:viridescent-venerer) artifact set holder, make sure you **don't immediately swap away** after casting Skill/Burst, you need to be on-field when the swirl reaction happens for you to trigger the 4-set effect.


# === characters.#sucrose.roles.#em_build.notes ===

People often compare Sucrose with Venti for Crowd-Control capabilities, but that's not what you'll be looking for. Sucrose is a character that can give Elemental Mastery to her teammates through swirling the correct elements (Ascension 1 Talent), which improves reaction damage for the Characters benefitting from the EM boost. Her Ascension 4 Talent also boosts the entire team's EM by 20% of Sucrose's total EM, this is why you want to stack as much elemental mastery as possible in her artifacts. As a support, most of Sucrose's value lies on her Ascension 1 and 4 talents, hence leveling her other talents (Normal Attack, Skill, and Burst) is not required.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

It's important to note that these weapons were ranked based on how much EM they offered you. However, this doesn't take into account how much each catalyst benefits your entire team's DPS.

[Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers](#weapon:thrilling-tales-of-dragon-slayers)<br>
This weapon does not provide any EM, however it overtakes the other weapons on the list when it comes to enabling your team. It offers **48% ATK** boost to the character you swap to which is equivalent to 1 main stat. This enables your DPS more if compared to [Sacrificial Fragments](#weapon:sacrificial-fragments) which only gives \~44EM, equivalent to only 2 substats.

[Hakushin Ring](#weapon:hakushin-ring)<br>
Is a good option for teams where Sucrose can swirl Electro to trigger its damage-boosting passive. In Electro - Charged teams, she can buff Hydro DMG% as well.

[Widsith](#weapon:the-widsith)<br>
This weapon is only useful if you get the EM passive from it. As such, it is **not recommended for general gameplay** but only if you want the highest possible EM buff.

[Favonius Codex](#weapon:favonius-codex)<br>
This weapon can be useful if you need Sucrose's Elemental Burst up as often as possible for **grouping.** You may need to get a few crit rate substats to trigger the passive reliably.<br>
There are some team compositions in which Sucrose's Elemental Mastery is not a priority, such as Freeze teams or an Anemo battery for Xiao. In such situations it's better for Sucrose to use to [Thrilling Tales of the Dragon Slayers](#weapon:thrilling-tales-of-dragon-slayers).

**Regarding Energy Recharge Priority**

Ranking is based on the assumption that Sucrose has [Sacrificial Fragments](#weapon:sacrificial-fragments) and is not valued for her Burst in teams that may not want Sucrose's Burst interfering with elemental auras. Energy Recharge could be prioritized higher when Sucrose is utilized in teams that don't really mind which element is being applied first and last (e.g. Electro-charged).


# === characters.#tartaglia.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://tinyurl.com/4nnv5euy)  from Childe Mains


# === characters.#tartaglia.roles.#dps.tips ===

**Optimal skill duration for \[C0\]:** 7s, 9s or 12s.<br>
**Optimal skill duration for \[C1\]:** 9s, 11s or 14s.

**Melee Burst**<br>
 Only to be used in situations where you need only 1 rotation to clear as the ER requirement to maintain burst uptime is quite high **(170-190%),** you'll always want to start your rotations with Ranged Burst since it refunds energy to maintain your rotation well.

**Skill Combo**<br>
- 2 NA + 1 CA (Optimal)<br>
- 3 NA + 1 CA (Recommended)<br>
- 5 NA + 1 CA (Recommended combo if using Rust or Thundering Pulse)

**\*NA = Normal Attack, CA = Charged Attack**

**The Optimal combo provides more damage but consumes more stamina. Recommended combo provides slightly less damage but is more stamina efficient.**


# === characters.#tartaglia.roles.#dps.notes ===

**The Weapon Rankings here are under the assumption that Childe is used with Bennett and Vaporises his Burst, aswell as using the optimal attack combos listed in the Ability Tips section**

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Polar Star](#weapon:polar-star)**<br>
Has varied performance depending on **how many passive stacks you get.** Getting **2-3 stacks at the start of your rotation can perform better than Thundering Pulse** while getting **no stacks can perform worse than Skyward Harp.**  This only applies if you are Vaporising Childe Burst together with Bennett. **In teams without Bennett, Polar Star will always perform better than the other options.** 3 stacks can be achieved by doing **Skill + 1 Normal + 1 Charged Attack** before setting up your Vaporise Burst. If your Skill is still on cooldown, **a fully Charged Aimed shot against a riptide affected target,** OR a **Ranged Normal + quick Aimed shot** gives 2 stacks (which can be followed by Skill for the 3rd stack).

**[Thundering Pulse](#weapon:thundering-pulse)**<br>
Slightly better than Skyward Harp depending on rotations - the more time you spend doing Normal Attacks, the more it pulls ahead over Skyward Harp, but it's not recommended to extend your Childe's melee rotation for this.

**[Viridescent Hunt](#weapon:the-viridescent-hunt)**<br>
Offers a valuable passive that helps a lot in **grouping enemies,** which can offer a ton of damage from Riptide.

**[Blackcliff Warbow](#weapon:blackcliff-warbow)**<br>
Due to inconsistency of gaining stacks, **falls off compared to other weapons at higher refinements.**

**[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)**<br>
Requires you to trigger its passive by hitting the enemy's weak points, **falls off if compared with other options without the passive triggered.**

**[The Stringless<br>
](#weapon:the-stringless)Main DPS Childe should only use this weapon in teams where you are Vaporising your Burst,** as the Elemental Mastery substat loses alot of value in other teams. If Childe is being used as a **Nuke Support only for his Vaporised Burst damage, R5 Stringless will rank just below Thundering Pulse.** Note that the stringless elemental skill passive does not affect Childe's melee stance auto attacks.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Heart of Depth (2) ](#artifact:heart-of-depth)+ [18% ATK set (2)](#artifact:18%-atk)**<br>
This set is **only about 1-2 substats behind Heart of Depth (4),** you can opt out for this set instead if you already have decent pieces.

**[Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4)](#artifact:shimenawas-reminiscence)**<br>
Due to this set requiring Childe to have around 140% Energy Recharge to reliably burst every rotation, it falls behind the other options. However, it outperforms **Heart of Depth (4)** if used in a single rotation setting **(ignoring ER).**


# === characters.#thoma.roles.#support.subStats.notes ===

Crit Rate is an option when using Favonius Lance.


# === characters.#thoma.roles.#support.notes ===

Thoma ideally wants to focus on shield over damage, and his burst uptime is required to achieve better shields, which is why he needs ER% on top of HP%.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Black Tassel](#weapon:black-tassel)<br>
At \[C4\], Thoma gains 15 energy when he fires his Elemental Burst. This effectively reduces his energy cost to 65 and makes it possible to use Black Tassel with ER sands instead of ER weapon with ER sands to furthermore strengthen his shield.


# === characters.#traveler-anemo.roles.#anemo_dps.subStats.notes ===

Crit Rate / DMG will have higher priority for a full Crit build


# === characters.#traveler-anemo.roles.#anemo_dps.notes ===

This section is dedicated to utilising the Anemo Traveler's Elemental Skill / Burst. Due to how little field time this playstyle takes, the Traveler can also fulfill the role of a quickswap style Sub-DPS.

Anemo Traveler can require up to 160% Energy Recharge.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

Anemo Traveler can either go for a **full Elemental Mastery** build or a **full ATK/Crit** build without much difference in damage. The weapon rankings listed here will not change much between the two builds.

[Sacrificial Sword](#weapon:sacrificial-sword)<br>
This weapon's ranking assumes you make use of the passive Elemental Skill reset, however doing so will require you to **stay onfield for a much longer period of time which may not be ideal sometimes.**<br>

[Amenoma Kageuchi](#weapon:amenoma-kageuchi)<br>
This weapon **reduces your ER% requirements to \~135% at \[R1\] and \~110% at \[R5\].** At \[**R5\],** this weapon will be **better than Sacrificial Sword.**

[Favonius Sword](#weapon:favonius-sword)<br>
Although this weapon does not provide much damage, **the Energy generated by the passive can sometimes be more beneficial to your team.** Make sure to build some amount of Crit rate to reliably trigger the passive.


# === characters.#traveler-anemo.roles.#physical_dps.notes ===

**Not Recommended for End Game Content.**

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Pale Flame (4)](#artifact:pale-flame)<br>
When running this set, make sure you do Press Cast and not Hold Cast, as the Hold Cast Skill Cooldown would be too long for you to refresh your stacks.


# === characters.#traveler-electro.roles.#support.tips ===

It is not recommended to level Elemental Skill and Burst past talent level 7 as the amount of energy generated does not increase.


# === characters.#traveler-electro.roles.#support.notes ===

Traveler can provide a lot of energy and Energy Recharge to the on-field character through their Elemental Skill pick up or Elemental Burst procs. This is especially useful with a damage dealer that doesn't conflict with traveler's element and can benefit from the abundance of energy. Due to the low damage scaling on Electro Traveler's Elemental Skill and Burst, its recommended to build Electro Traveler by just stacking Energy Recharge to amplify the batterying power.


# === characters.#traveler-geo.roles.#geo_dps.tips ===

Skill and Burst have equal priorities.<br>
When using your Elemental Skill, try to use the hold variant of it over tapping, as it has a slight delay on the tap variant.


# === characters.#traveler-geo.roles.#geo_dps.notes ===

This section is dedicated to utilising the Geo Traveler's Geo Elemental Burst damage capabilities. Due to how little field time this playstyle takes, the Traveler can also fulfill the role of a quickswap style Sub-DPS.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Festering Desire](#weapon:festering-desire), [Skyward Blade](#weapon:skyward-blade), [Amenoma Kageuchi](#weapon:amenoma-kageuchi)**<br>
These weapons help in bursting off cooldown, but if you're not having issues with energy, then these weapons falls behind in terms of damage.


# === characters.#traveler-geo.roles.#physical_dps.artifacts.notes ===

Check notes for Pale Flame (4)


# === characters.#traveler-geo.roles.#physical_dps.notes ===

Not Recommended for End Game Content.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Gladiator's Finale (2) Pale Flame (2)](#artifact:gladiators-finale)<br>
This set is ranked higher than Pale Flame (2) Bloodstained Chivalry (2) due to how much Geo Damage is in the Traveler's kit. If you truly prefer to have the highest physical damage output, use Set 2 instead.

[Pale Flame (4)<br>
](#artifact:pale-flame)**This set is not recommended** due to the Traveler's Elemental Skill cooldown being 6 seconds, which means the 4 piece set effect only kicks in 6 seconds into every rotation, and also gives the player a very little time window to keep up the 4 piece set effect.


# === characters.#venti.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/venti/) from KQM


# === characters.#venti.roles.#off-field_dps.subStats.notes ===

Crit Rate / DMG isn't as important in a triple EM build, which is what is assumed here.


# === characters.#venti.roles.#off-field_dps.talents.notes ===

For an EM-focused build, upgrading Venti's talent levels isn't a necessity.


# === characters.#venti.roles.#off-field_dps.tips ===

Make sure you don't immediately swap away after casting Burst, you need to be on-field for VV 4-set perk to proc on swirl first.(E > Q to avoid this issue)

You can infuse elements onto Venti's Burst if you walk up with an element status on you. (e.g. Bennett Burst > Venti Burst > Walk up to infuse Pyro)

Check out [this link](http://tinyurl.com/ventiburstinfo) to see which characters can hit the enemies sucked and ragdolled in Venti's burst. (Sheet has not been updated since Yanfei release)


# === characters.#venti.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

This build focuses on damage over ER because of his ER ascension stat. This weapon order is in the assumption of EM Venti, as Crit Venti's damage potential is limited to either extremely high investment or single target situations.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Skyward Harp](#weapon:skyward-harp)<br>
Due to EM build assumptions, the stats offered aren't very valuable. Consider reading the In-depth Guide from KQM if you're interested in a Crit-focused build.

[Elegy for the End](#weapon:elegy-for-the-end)<br>
Elegy for the End's ATK buff DOES NOT buff Venti's burst if Venti is the one equipping the bow, but the EM buff affects Venti's Swirl reaction. This is due to Venti's burst snapshotting his stats (excluding EM toward transformative reactions such as Swirl) at the time of cast. While an **\[R1\]** Elegy of the End yields slightly lower Venti damage compared to an **\[R5\]** Stringless (\~7% assuming 50% Elegy buff uptime), it provides a party-wide ATK and EM buff which can be better in terms of total team damage and comfortable ER.


# === characters.#xiangling.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/xiangling/) from KQM


# === characters.#xiangling.roles.#off-field_dps.tips ===

A few commonly used teams for pyro Xiangling are:

**National Team:** Xiangling, Xingqiu, Bennett and a Flex unit (Sucrose/Zhongli/Kazuha/Raiden/Chongyun/etc)

**Childe Team:** Childe, Xiangling, Bennett and a Flex unit (Sucrose/Zhongli/Venti/Kazuha/etc)

_**Recommended ER thresholds:**_

**National/Childe Teams:** 160-200 ER%<br>
**Enabler for Reverse Melt teams:** 200-250 ER%


# === characters.#xiangling.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**THIS LIST ASSUMES THAT XIANGLING IS RUN WITH BOTH BENNETT AND A SECONDARY BUFFER (i.e. Kazuha/Sucrose)**

[Wavebreaker's Fin](#weapon:wavebreakers-fin)<br>
\[R5\] Wavebreaker's Fin is equal to or outperforms Staff of Homa, depending on your total team burst cost.

[Dragon's Bane](#weapon:dragons-bane)<br>
\[R5\] Dragon's Bane outperforms Primordial Jade-Winged Spear.

[Kitain Cross Spear](#weapon:kitain-cross-spear)<br>
Kitain Cross Spear's passive reduces the ER threshold of Xiangling greatly, down to \~140 ER% at \[R1\] and \~110 ER% at \[R5\]. This allows you to distribute ER rolls into otherwise offensive substats and due to this, an \[R5\] Kitain Cross Spear can outperform Primordial Jade-Winged Spear. Due to lowering ER thresholds so much, the Crimson Witch of Flames (4) artifact set will outperform Emblem of Severed Fate (4).

[Lithic Spear](#weapon:lithic-spear)<br>
\[R5\] Lithic Spear with 2 stacks performs equal to Primordial Jade-Winged Spear.

[Favonius Lance](#weapon:favonius-lance)<br>
The utility provided from a highly refined Favonius Lance can make it a weapon of choice in a team comp where Xiangling is not triggering the reaction and is instead used as an aura. (i.e. Reverse Melt teams)

**Regarding Weapons and Artifacts with EM stat**

[Dragon's Bane](#weapon:dragons-bane) / [Kitain Cross Spear ](#weapon:kitain-cross-spear)**/ EM substats**<br>
In team comps where you can trigger both Vaporise and Overload at the same time (i.e. Raiden National), Elemental Mastery gets more value, pushing these weapons and artifacts ahead in damage.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Crimson Witch (4)](#artifact:crimson-witch-of-flames)**<br>
This set pulls ahead over Emblem of Severed Fate (4) on team comps where Xiangling triggers Overloads in addition to Vaporise (i.e. Raiden National).

**[The Exile (2) Scholar (2)](#artifact:the-exile)**<br>
This set can be used as a **very low investment support build to enable Reverse Melt team comps** where Xiangling is not triggering the reaction and is instead used as an aura and needs a lot of Energy Recharge. Note that it is **not recommended to stay on this build as Xiangling can still contribute respectable damage with offensive stats.**


# === characters.#xiangling.roles.#physical_dps.notes ===

**It is not recommended to run Physical DPS Xiangling since Xiangling excels more as an Off-field Pyro DPS.** Physical Xiangling is only good for early game.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Crescent Pike](#weapon:crescent-pike)<br>
Crescent Pike is extremely strong on Xiangling due to the nature of her attack combo, Crescent Pike continues to surpass Primordial Jade Winged-Spear in terms of Normal/Charge Attack Damage.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Pale Flame (4)](#artifact:pale-flame)<br>
The passive from this set can have 100% uptime through using Guoba off cooldown.


# === characters.#xiao.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/xiao/) from Xiao Mains + KQM


# === characters.#xiao.roles.#dps.artifacts.notes ===

It is worth noting that set bonuses do not increase Xiao's damage by much, due to an oversaturation on DMG% bonuses and ATK% from various sources. For this reason, it is better to opt out for artifact pieces which have higher quality substats instead of trying to maintain a set bonus.


# === characters.#xiao.roles.#dps.tips ===

**Regarding Xiao's Optimal Skill Rotation**<br>
Skill -> Skill -> Burst -> Plunge Combo

**Regarding Xiao's Plunge Combo**

**Best combo for Xiao when fighting a single target**<br>
Plunge -> Normal Attack -> Charged Attack -> Plunge

**Best combo for Xiao when fighting multiple enemies**<br>
Plunge -> Normal Attack -> Plunge


# === characters.#xiao.roles.#dps.notes ===

Xiao has issues with Energy regeneration because **he cannot generate any particles with his Elemental Skill while his Burst is active,** so it is not suggested to use his Elemental Skill during Elemental Burst.

Start off a fight by casting the skill of your Anemo Battery and then casting his skill twice then cast your burst immediately. You will want to be half way through your burst animation before the particles reach you, so this way you can start off your burst with a portion of the energy gauge already filled.

**You'll want to pair Xiao with another Anemo character** (Venti, Sucrose, Jean or Anemo Traveler) to help him gain energy while his Elemental Burst is on cooldown. Xiao's Elemental Burst ends when you swap to another character. Although he has two charges of his Elemental Skill, only ONE charge comes back per cooldown.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

With a proper anemo battery (e.g. Sucrose), Xiao needs as little as 120-130% ER to maintain a high burst uptime. In these scenarios, unless there are no ER from substats, you should always go for a non-ER weapon as it will result in more damage.

[Calamity Queller](#weapon:calamity-queller)<br>
This weapon has a really high Base ATK, which means you benefit more from ATK% buffs (e.g. Thrilling Tales of the Dragon Slayers) if compared with other weapons.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

Prioritize Viridescent Venerer over the other 2 +18% ATK sets if there are external ATK% buff sources on your team.

**Regarding Artifact Main Stats**

Anemo DMG% goblets are recommended for Xiao. ATK% goblets serve as a good alternative for him.


# === characters.#xingqiu.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RQI5IjLZKqsVhQzRDr7FTYgQX66jKB28PnwoZVlQ4_k/edit) by Quincy#6965


# === characters.#xingqiu.roles.#off-field_dps.subStats.notes ===

Prioritize Energy Recharge first if you can't burst off cooldown


# === characters.#xingqiu.roles.#off-field_dps.tips ===

Activating XQ's Elemental Skill or Elemental Burst applies Hydro to the on-field character with his shield. (Pyro in specific)

Cleansing Electro may take an additional switch for your character with the rain swords active, while Cryo would freeze you in place.


# === characters.#xingqiu.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

The weapon rankings assume you are running enough Energy Recharge to get Xingqiu's burst up off cooldown. This is usually 180-200% ER for Sacrificial Sword before \[C6\] and 150-170% ER after \[C6\], while \~240% ER for other weapons before \[C6\] and \~190% ER after \[C6\].

**[Primordial Jade Cutter](#weapon:primordial-jade-cutter)**<br>
This is Xingqiu's best in slot weapon if ran with sufficient ER (240% ER before **\[C6\]** and 190% ER after **\[C6\]**).

**[Sacrifical Sword](#weapon:sacrificial-sword)**<br>
This ranking assumes you can trigger the passive on every Elemental Skill. This is only possible at **\[R3+\]** if you are using Elemental Skill off cooldown. **At lower refines, this weapon would rank below [Skyward Blade](#weapon:skyward-blade).

**[Favonius Sword](#weapon:favonius-sword)**<br>
Although this weapon has lower damage potential on Xingqiu, the extra team energy generated by the passive may be more useful than his personal damage in some teams.

**[Harbinger of Dawn](#weapon:harbinger-of-dawn)**<br>
This is a great weapon for Xingqiu, assuming he's either **\[C6\]** or teamed with another Hydro character for energy generation.

**Regarding Weapon Order on \[C6\]**

When Xingqiu is **\[C6\],** Mistsplitter and Jade Cutter has the best damage potential given enough ER (170-190%), Skyward Blade has the second best damage potential (same ER requirement as Jade), and Sacrificial Sword has the third best damage potential.

Big thanks to Quincy#6965 for helping us [with the weapons calculations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wv1WXpkFkTX8SLCWLoQXlyxwnB2ZXZqQ6c9tSSVCAvQ/edit#gid=0).

**Regarding Artifact Set**

**[Emblem of Severed Fate (4)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate)**<br>
If you already have an invested **\[C6\]** Xingqiu build with Noblesse Oblige (2) Heart of Depth (2) and Sacrificial Sword, you don't need to farm for this set.

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**<br>
Offers party-wide ATK boost, you can use this set on Xingqiu if nobody else on the party is equipping it.

**[Thundersoothers (4)](#artifact:thundersoother)**<br>
This set is only recommended if you're running an electrocharged team. It's essentially the same as Noblesse Oblige (2) Heart of Depth (2) in terms of damage boost, but it also increases Elemental Skill damage, it comes with a condition though; the enemy needs to be affected by Electro aura. **Not recommended to specifically farm for this set.**

**[Blizzard Strayer (4)](#artifact:blizzard-strayer)**<br>
This set is only recommended on a freeze team to optimize Xingqiu's stats since he can just disregard Crit Rate and build Crit Damage instead for more damage output. Despite it outperforming **Emblem of Severed Fate (4)** within this niche, **it is generally not recommended to specifically farm for this set.**

**[The Exile (2) Scholar (2)](#artifact:the-exile)**<br>
This set is a cheap beginner option to maintain burst uptime well since it gives 40% Energy Recharge. Note that it is **not recommended to stay on this set as Xingqiu contributes alot of damage in his teams.**

**Regarding Main Stats Priority**

Ideally you would be running ATK% Sands when your ER needs are fulfilled. (\~180-200% if Sacrificial Sword, \~240% for others).


# === characters.#xinyan.roles.#dps.tips ===

Xinyan's ES grants you a pyro status upon contact with shield. No matter how many times you switch your characters, it'll still apply pyro every instant you switch with shield. This allows you to cleanse every single elemental status that has been applied to you.

If the status doesn't get cleansed, switch on that character one more time with the shield. Pyro doesn't cleanse Hydro very efficiently, take Cecilia Garden for example, you'll have to apply pyro on your character 4 times before actually cleansing the hydro status.


# === characters.#xinyan.roles.#dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Serpent Spine](#weapon:serpent-spine)<br>
It is worth noting that an **\[R5\] Serpent Spine** can outperform all 5 star weapons at **\[R1\]** with proper stack management

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Bloodstained Chivalry (4)](#artifact:bloodstained-chivalry)<br>
Despite how dependant Xinyan's playstyle can get with Charged Attacks, Bloodstained Chivalry Full Set is still not recommended due to it only coming in effect after a kill.


# === characters.#xinyan.roles.#shield_support.subStats.notes ===

**ER:** takes priority over ATK% for shield support


# === characters.#xinyan.roles.#shield_support.subStats.advices.1.notes ===

Crit DMG if C2


# === characters.#xinyan.roles.#shield_support.notes ===

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)<br>
This set can be used on Xinyan if nobody else on the team is using this set for the partywide ATK buff.

**[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith) and [Sacrificial Greatsword](#weapon:sacrificial-greatsword)**<br>
Xinyan support is mostly used for her Shield and/or Elemental Burst damage. If you want to use her as a Physical Support, she needs both her Ascension 4 Talent and \[C4\] to maximize her support capabilities, making her a somewhat expensive choice to be considered for Physical Support role. However, the Tenacity of the Millelith set gives her a new role with a lower Constellation level prerequisite.

**[Tenacity of the Millelith](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
This set gives Xinyan a unique role among the shielders. Currently, Xinyan is one of the few shielders in the game who can make full use of the Tenacity set's effects. If you can maximize the uptime of Xinyan's Level 3 shield, she can provide a constant 30% Shield Strength and 20% Atk boost to the team (as long as the pulses hit an enemy). This means that **Sacrificial Greatsword** and Xinyan's \[C2\] are crucial to making this set shine on her. This set isn't as recommended for her if you have neither of the two.

Shield uptime is also crucial to maximizing her Physical/Shield Support capabilities. If you have neither Sacrificial Greatsword nor at least \[C2\] (but ideally \[C4\]) on Xinyan, you may want to build her as a Burst Support instead of Physical/Shield Support.

At \[C2\], her burst "Riff Revolution" has a 100% Crit Rate, which means you can build solely Crit Dmg (instead of trying to get a 1:2 Crit Rate:Crit DMG ratio) if you're building her as a Physical Burst support.

**Generally not recommended for Pyro Applications, as the pulses only happen at Shield Level 3, and are not very efficient at breaking Cryo shields.**

# === characters.#yae-miko.roles.#off-field_dps.tips ===

Start your rotations with Yae's Elemental Skill to amplify her Elemental Burst damage.

**Burst combo**<br>
Skill > Skill > Skill > Burst > Skill > Skill > Skill

Take note that none of Yae Miko's abilities snapshot.


# === characters.#yae-miko.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Solar Pearl](#weapon:solar-pearl)**<br>
This weapon benefits a lot from refines and attack buffs like Bennett. \[R5\] Solar Pearl without buffs, or a low refine Solar Pearl with Bennett buff can perform similar to [Skyward Atlas](#weapon:skyward-atlas). Note that you should do a Normal Attack when you swap in and before you swap out of Yae Miko to keep good uptime on the passive.

**[The Widsith](#weapon:the-widsith)**<br>
Despite Yae's A4 bonus, the EM buff is bad. **Over many rotations Widsith will be worse than equal refinement [Solar Pearl](#weapon:solar-pearl) regardless of buff, and can be worse than [Oathsworn](#weapon:oathsworn-eye) if you only get the EM buff.** If you are trying for one rotation speedruns and are willing to reset till you get the DMG% or ATK buff, **this weapon ranks much higher** and can outperform the 5 stars. Otherwise, it is recommended to use the other options above Widsith for more consistent damage.

**[Hakushin Ring](#weapon:hakushin-ring)**<br>
This weapon's passive can buff your other team members, which **may be more beneficial than Yae Miko's personal damage** depending on the team and rotation used. Note that the passive cannot be triggered when off-field.

**Regarding Artifact Choices**

**[Emblem of Severed Fate (4)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate)**<br>
This set works best for Yae in **multi-target scenarios** where her Elemental Burst hits multiple enemies. This set also provides more value if she's used WITHOUT Raiden (due to the higher ER requirements).

**[+18% ATK set (2)](#artifact:18%-atk) / [Thundering Fury (2)](#artifact:thundering-fury) / [Emblem of Severed Fate (2)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate)**<br>
Using a combination of these artifact sets works best for Yae in **single-target scenarios.** These also **provide more value** if she's paired WITH Raiden (due to lower ER requirements).

**[Thundersoother (4)](#artifact:thundersoother)**<br>
Assuming you are able to maintain 100% uptime on its passive, this is Yae's BiS set. This set works best for Yae in Electro-charged teams.

**[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
This set trades Yae's personal damage for a team wide 20% ATK buff. It is **not recommended to specifically farm this set for Yae.** Only use this if you already have good pieces from farming Pale Flame for your Physical DPSes.

**Regarding Talent Priority**

Do note that Yae's Elemental Burst does more damage than her Elemental Skill when it hits multiple enemies.

Big thanks to _Fob#6835_ for helping us with [the weapon/artifact rankings.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kDgkF3ZCa6MiQJLFzSXVBqbLrhe-0fNk/edit#gid=606412994)


# === characters.#yanfei.roles.#dps.tips ===

Yanfei's Ascension 4 Talent does a second hit after a Crit Charge Attack. This scales 80% of your ATK and can trigger reactions as well due to having a separate internal cooldown on its pyro application. <br>


# === characters.#yanfei.roles.#dps.notes ===

Yanfei can have trouble trying to set up for her reaction DPS. Vaporize is generally the more consistent option and you need Xingqiu to make this work best. When running a Vaporize team with Xingqiu, 3 normal attacks into a charged attack (N1>N2>N3>C) is the safest and most reliable way to vaporize your charged attacks. Make sure you're adding applying hydro first before starting combos.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds](#weapon:lost-prayer-to-the-sacred-winds)<br>
Bennett buff/ Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer's buff + Noblesse Oblige (4) will push Lost Prayer ahead of Skyward Atlas and Memory of Dust

[Dodoco Tales](#weapon:dodoco-tales)<br>
On equal refinements, Widsith is better than Dodoco Tales, but assuming it's **\[R5\]** Dodoco Tales vs **\[R1\]**-**\[R3\]** Widsith, **\[R5\]** Dodoco Tales is better. **Note that Bennett buff / Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer's buff + Noblesse Oblige (4) buff may push Widsith and Solar Pearl above Dodoco Tales, even at low refinements.**

**Regarding Artifact Set**

[Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4)](#artifact:shimenawas-reminiscence)<br>
Yanfei will rarely have her burst up due to the 15 energy cost on the 4-piece effect, however she can instead **maintain the 4-piece DMG buff over a longer duration, making this set a good alternative to the other options.** Note that this set loses out on some value at higher constellations, as she can't get her **\[C4\]** effects without casting Burst.

[Retracing Bolide (4)](#artifact:retracing-bolide)<br>
Running Yanfei with a shield character also allows you to make use of a full Retracing Bolide 4-set as a placeholder until you're able to find a good Crimson Witch 4-set.

**Regarding Artifact Substats Priority**

Energy Recharge is prioritized over Elemental Mastery here since she has an 80 energy burst cost while her skill is also not very efficient at generating particles for getting it back. A major source of your energy will be coming from enemies as well as potential pyro batteries like Bennett, so be sure to have her pick the particles up as off-field characters only get 0.6x the value of the particles.


# === characters.#yanfei.roles.#shield_support__[c4+_required].talents.notes ===

Yanfei's talent levels provide nothing for this role and it is not recommended to level them.


# === characters.#yanfei.roles.#shield_support__[c4+_required].tips ===

_**Energy Recharge Guidelines**_

Prototype Amber \[R5\]: 210 ER<br>
Prototype Amber \[R1\] /Favonius Codex: 240 ER<br>
Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers: 250+ ER


# === characters.#yanfei.roles.#shield_support__[c4+_required].notes ===

This section is dedicated to a playstyle where Yanfei is utilised as a primary shielder through her 4th Constellation. Due to the requirement of having to burst off cooldown, this build has **high energy requirements.**

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/yoimiya/) from Yoimiya Mains + KQM


# === characters.#yoimiya.roles.#dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Rust](#weapon:rust)**<br>
At higher refinements, this weapon can outperform a low refined Amos' Bow and Skyward Harp.

**[Hamayumi](#weapon:hamayumi)**<br>
If you're using Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4), this weapon doesn't synergize well with that artifact set due to its passive.

**[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)**<br>
Note that you want to proc the weapon passive by doing a quick charged shot on the enemy's weakspot for this weapon to be good.

**[Slingshot](#weapon:slingshot)**<br>
With a large amount of external ATK buffs, this weapon is competitive to \[R1\] Rust. Note that you have to be in range for Slingshot's passive and have good uptime on the ATK buffs.

**Regarding Artifacts**

**[Crimson Witch of Flames (2)](#artifact:crimson-witch-of-flames) + [18% ATK set (2)](#artifact:18%-atk)**<br>
The best generalist set on Yoimiya as it is competitive with the other options for personal damage and works in every situation.

**[Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4)](#artifact:shimenawas-reminiscence)**<br>
Offers more personal damage on Yoimiya but it sacrifices her Elemental Burst uptime which translates to lower overall team DPS due to not being able to fully benefit from her Ascension 4 passive.

**[Crimson Witch of Flames (4)](#artifact:crimson-witch-of-flames)**<br>
The go-to artifact set for Vaporize focused Pyro carries, excels over the other options especially on a reaction focused team comp.

**[Lavawalker (4)](#artifact:lavawalker)**<br>
Good option on a mono Pyro team comp where Yoimiya can have 100% uptime on the artifact passive.

**Regarding Mainstats**

**Elemental Mastery**<br>
A good option if Yoimiya is **triggering Vaporise and/or Overload.** Having Bennett in the team favours Elemental Mastery sands slightly more than ATK sands, however it is recommended to just use whichever has better substats.

**Regarding Talent Priorities**

Elemental Skill scales very poorly which is why it is the least priority. If you do not care about her Elemental Burst damage output, you can prioritize Elemental Skill over Elemental Burst, but Normal Attack talent still has the most priority since it's the main source of Yoimiya's damage.


# === characters.#yun-jin.roles.#support.notes ===

Yun Jin is a Support character for Normal Attack focused characters who can deal off-field damage via her Elemental Burst. Yun Jin's **Elemental Burst grants nearby party members 30 stacks of additional flat damage bonus on Normal Attacks which scales with Yun Jin's current DEF.** This means that external DEF buffs like from Gorou's Elemental Skill and/or Burst doesn't provide much to Yun Jin since it only buffs active characters and not off-field ones.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Favonius Lance](#weapon:favonius-lance)<br>
With this weapon, try to aim for some Crit Rate stats to trigger the weapon passive reliably.

[Kitain Cross Spear](#weapon:kitain-cross-spear)<br>
Although the EM mainstat isn't useful for Yun Jin, the **passive decreases her Energy Recharge requirements** by alot, especially at higher refinements. **It can reduce her ER% reqs from around \~20% at R1 to \~70% at R5.** Note that **she must cast Elemental Burst first before Skill, as the passive drains 3 energy initially when Skill is cast.** If you only care about the Energy Recharge, this weapon can be left at level 1 while still getting full effect from the passive.

**Regarding Artifact Main Stats and Substats Priority:**

Crit Rate should only be considered when Yun Jin is equpping Favonius Lance to reliably proc the passive.


# === characters.#zhongli.roles.#physical_dps.notes ===

**Optimal Physical Rotation:**<br>
Normal Attack until Spear Kick -> Dodge/Jump Cancel -> Repeat


# === characters.#zhongli.roles.#shield_support.notes ===

**This kind of playstyle is very straightforward; stack as much HP as possible. Prioritize HP scaling polearms such as Black Tassel and artifact sets such as Tenacity of the Millelith (4) to capitalize on Zhongli's Shield.** Most of the time, especially on a HP-focused Zhongli, casting Elemental Burst is a DPS loss due to the cast time, which is why you'd only want to cast Elemental Burst for the Crowd Control it offers, and not for damage.

Note that if paired with Xingqiu and/or Beidou, the damage reduction from orbitals from Xingqiu's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst and/or Beidou's Elemental Burst can be utilized on Zhongli's shield, making it basically unbreakable.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Favonius Lance](#weapon:favonius-lance)<br>
Use this weapon over [Black Tassel](#weapon:black-tassel) if you value the team energy (Note that you need to build some amount of Crit Rate if you are running Favonius Lance to trigger the passive).


# === characters.#zhongli.roles.#burst_support.notes ===

Zhongli can be utilized as a Geo Burst damage dealer due to his short Elemental Burst cooldown (12s) and low energy cost (40 Energy). His Elemental Skill Hold Cast (Shield) scales with HP and at Ascension 4, you would unlock a talent that allows your Elemental Burst to scale with 33% of Zhongli's Max HP, making him a great source of Shield and damage.

**Regarding Artifact Main Stats**

ATK sands provides more damage than HP sands, but it does have lesser Shield HP. If you want more Shield HP, you can consider running a HP sands.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Noblesse Oblige (2)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige) + [Archaic Petra (2)](#artifact:archaic-petra)**<br>
On lower ER requirements where Zhongli doesn't need to worry about his energy needs, this set pulls ahead of [Emblem of Severed Fate (4)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate).

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**<br>
This set provides Zhongli more utility when casting his Elemental Burst, you can use this set on Zhongli if there is nobody else on the team who's equipping this set.

**[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
Just like Noblesse Oblige (4), this set provides Zhongli with more utility if his Elemental Skill hits an enemy. This set also provides Zhongli with stronger shields.
