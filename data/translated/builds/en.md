off-field dps


# === characters.#albedo.roles.#off-field_dps.tips ===

Albedo's Elemental Skill particle generation is completely RNG like Zhongli, but with better odds.


# === characters.#albedo.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

Albedo is a character that can summon a Geo Construct from his Elemental Skill which deals damage on a 2 second interval whenever enemies in the field are damaged. His Elemental Burst provides 125 EM to the party, which is good on teams that rely on amplification reactions, such as Vaporize. It is worth noting that since his stat priority is focused on DEF (Elemental Skill scaling), you might want to skip casting Elemental Burst if your team doesn't benefit from the 125 EM buff. Another option is to build him with ATK-DEF Hybrid, which ends up with lower Skill damage but higher Burst damage.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Harbinger of Dawn](#weapon:harbinger-of-dawn)<br>
 Albedo's Elemental Skill scales with Defense, which is why the Base ATK from the weapon doesn't matter that much. Harbinger of Dawn offers a lot of Crit stats which is why it is one of the strongest weapons for him despite being a 3 star weapon. The downside of this weapon is that you'd need to keep Albedo's HP at 90% or higher to benefit from the passive, so it might be annoying to use against certain enemies which has a HP lowering debuff, even when off-field, such as Corrosion.

[Mistsplitter Reforged](#weapon:mistsplitter-reforged)<br>
 Realistically you are only able to get 2 stacks of this weapon's passive and this requires setup. Generally just use Harbinger of Dawn instead and give your Mistsplitter Reforged to another sword DPS character.

[Freedom-Sworn](#weapon:freedom-sworn)<br>
Equipping this weapon will decrease Albedo's own damage significantly but he is one of the better Freedom-Sworn holders since he can trigger the passive quite easily to buff your other party members.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Husk of Opulent Dreams (4)](#artifact:husk-of-opulent-dreams)<br>
Due to Albedo's skill snapshotting upon cast, you need to either wait \~12 seconds before starting a domain/fight to reach max stacks or recast his skill to benefit from the DEF and Geo DMG bonus provided by the 4 piece set effect.

[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)<br>
This set is used for the 4 piece set effect which has good uptime on Albedo. Worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.

[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)<br>
If you don't have another character in your party that has this set, you can use this set on Albedo. You might want to get some Energy Recharge substats to maintain your Elemental Burst uptime for this. It is also worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.

**Regarding Artifact Substats Priority**

ATK and Energy Recharge substats are only valuable on a Hybrid Albedo that casts his Elemental Burst.

Until Requirement


# === characters.#alhaitham.roles.#spread_dps.subStats.notes ===

Certain quicken teams can run little to no Energy Recharge and simply burst every other rotation without a dps loss

**atk: **If you're running under 200 Elemental Mastery this substat has priority over Crit


# === characters.#alhaitham.roles.#spread_dps.talents.notes ===

≈ Burst


# === characters.#alhaitham.roles.#spread_dps.tips ===

**Basic Rotations:**

Burst up = Q > E > N2D + 2N3D + N1C + 2N2C

Burst down = E > N1C + 5N2C + N1

**The linked guide goes over his optimal rotations in more **detail


# === characters.#alhaitham.roles.#spread_dps.notes ===

This playstyle makes the best use of Alhaitham's kit. Since both Spread reactions, his skill (the primary source of his damage) and burst scale heavily off Elemental Mastery. Further enhanced by his high rate of on-field dendro application. All of this combined with his flexible teams and rotations makes him one of the best Spread DPS currently released. Lastly bear in mind that a large part of his damage comes from dendro reactions (especially in Quicken/Quickbloom teams), which scale heavily off his levels, so you should prioritise levelling him to 90/90.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**Light of Foliar Incision**
This weapon prefers EM sands even in situations with fewer or no Spread procs such as in Bloom/Burgeon/Hyperbloom teams.

**Toukabou Shigure**
This ranking assumes single-target situations, in AOE situations it starts falling behind weapons such as Iron Sting and Blackcliff Longsword.

**Harbinger of Dawn**
If you can maintain near perfect uptime on its passive this weapon will perform similarly to weapons like Haran Geppaku Futsu.<br>

**Xiphos' Moonlight / Festering Desire**
These weapons can perform similarly to The Black Sword in teams where you have higher Energy Recharge requirements or want to burst every rotation.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**Gilded Dreams (4)**
This ranking assumes that you already have another Deepwood Memories holder on the team, if not then Deepwood Memories becomes his best set.<br>

**Deepwood Memories (2) / Emblem of Severed Fate (2) / +80 EM set (2)**
These split set options can actually perform similarly to Gilded Dreams or even surpass it in situations where you have higher Energy Recharge requirements or want to burst every rotation. Or even if they just have better substat rolls on them.

**Regarding Mainstat Priorities**
Usually in Quicken/Quickbloom teams Alhaitham leans towards Elemental Mastery sands (roughly 5% or so difference usually). But in Bloom/Burgeon/Hyperbloom teams with, fewer to no Spread reactions, he skews more towards ATK% sands (unless you're using Light of Foliar Incision). Or even Energy Recharge sands if you're trying to burst every rotation for increased dendro seed generation in those teams.


# === characters.#aloy.roles.#burst_support.name ===

burst support


# === characters.#aloy.roles.#burst_support.notes ===

Aloy is much preferred as a Burst Support over Main DPS as getting coil stacks for her Cryo infusion can be quite unreliable. **Aloy needs 4 coil stacks to get the Cryo infusion and you can only get 1 stack every 0.1 seconds** which is quite hard to do considering the Bomblets are scattered all over the place. One thing to note regarding Aloy's coil stacks is that **she can still get coil stacks even when she's off-field.**

Aloy is very niche as she only performs well in certain comps and even then, she's still completely replaceable by other characters. **She can be utilized on a Freeze team** where she can be a battery and nuke at the same time since she provides 5 Cryo particles on her Elemental Skill. **She can also be utilized on a Melt team** where you can melt her Elemental Burst for quite a decent amount of damage.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Polar Star](#weapon:polar-star)<br>
Forcing to get Polar Star stacks isn't worth due to consuming extra time to get those stacks.

[The Stringless](#weapon:the-stringless)<br>
Placement was considering Aloy is used on a Reverse Melt team. On Reverse Melt Aloy, Stringless especially at higher refinement levels can pull ahead of Thundering Pulse.

[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)<br>
Assumes the passive is active by proccing a weak point shot. This weapon especially at higher refinement levels can be as good as Skyward Harp.

[Sacrificial Bow](#weapon:sacrificial-bow)<br>
A pretty decent option to make Aloy a Cryo battery as her Elemental Skill provides 5 Cryo particles.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

Elemental Mastery is only an option if your Aloy is played on a Reverse Melt team as it provides nothing to a Freeze Aloy.

[Blizzard Strayer (4)](#artifact:blizzard-strayer)<br>
This artifact set is best used on a Freeze-focused Aloy as it provides a ton of Crit Value.

**+80 EM set (2)**<br>
This artifact set bonus only benefits a Melt-focused Aloy, Elemental Mastery provides nothing on a Freeze Aloy.

[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)<br>
Aloy is one of the best Noblesse holders since she has low energy requirements and cooldown for her Elemental Burst.


# === characters.#amber.roles.#dps.name ===

dps


# === characters.#amber.roles.#dps.notes ===

Amber DPS will be focused on maximizing Charged Shot damage on enemy weak spots as Amber's Ascension 4 Talent increases ATK by 15% for 10s after hitting a weak spot. Crit is also guaranteed when you land your shot on a weak spot so we aim to maximize Crit DMG with little to no dependance on Crit Rate, this could change after \[C4\].

After \[C4\]**,** the playstyle catering towards her Skill damage becomes available, with this build you will want to run Crimson Witch of Flames (4) while trying to maintain the 1:2 Crit Ratio for more frequent nukes. This playstyle is safer, more consistent and has more AoE damage to play compared to Charge Shot Amber.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)<br>
This bow will beat Skyward Harp if it's \[R2+\].

[Hamayumi](#weapon:hamayumi)<br>
This bow will beat Sharpshooter's Oath \[R5\] if it's \[R2+\].

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Shimenawa's Reminiscence](#artifact:shimenawas-reminiscence)<br>
At \[C4\] this set will beat out Wanderer's Troupe for Amber Charged Shot Main DPS.

# === characters.#amber.roles.#support.name ===

support


# === characters.#amber.roles.#support.notes ===

Due to her poor scalings, this section is dedicated to a low-investment build that provides utility and shieldbreaking capabilities by abusing her quick Pyro application on her Elemental Burst. Due to her energy generation being extremely poor, her Energy Recharge options are prioritized.

**Regarding [Instructors (4)](#artifact:instructor)**

This set is preferred over 4p Noblesse Oblige when Amber is used as support in a Hu Tao vaporize team.


# === characters.#ayaka.roles.#dps.name ===

dps


# === characters.#ayaka.roles.#dps.subStats.notes ===

Crit Rate loses value here assuming you're running Blizzard Strayer (4), if you're not using that artifact set, then it has the same priority as Crit DMG, but you still want to aim for 1:2 ratio.


# === characters.#ayaka.roles.#dps.tips ===

Ayaka's Charged Attack, Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst is able to hit enemies inside sucked inside Venti's Elemental Burst.

Her Elemental Burst also stays in place on frozen enemies and slightly knocks enemies away when they're not frozen.


# === characters.#ayaka.roles.#dps.notes ===

Kamisato Ayaka is a pretty straightforward DPS that **deals most of her damage from her Elemental Burst.** She has very high scalings on her burst at the cost of it being 80 energy. You will likely need **another Cryo battery on the team** to provide energy for her (Diona, Kaeya, Rosaria, etc). She has a **special dash** (like Mona) and after she dashes, she will get a Cryo infusion on her Normal Attacks. Ensure you always have this bonus active to maximise your rotation damage.

She can be played on a **permafreeze team** (paired with a Hydro enabler such as Mona, Xingqiu, or even Barbara) where she could gain huge benefits from the **Blizzard Strayer (4) artifact set.** Blizzard Strayer (4) piece gives a huge amount of stats on a Freeze team, so try to get this artifact set as fast as you can. Her Elemental Burst also sticks on frozen enemies, but it also has a small hitbox so you need to position it well so that it can hit multiple bigger enemies.

**Regarding Main Stats Priority**

Circlet main stat will be dependant on your overall stats, depending on your overall stats, one can be better than the other. Since Ayaka is able to get a lot of Crit Value from Blizzard Strayer (4) set, ascension passive, and also possibly weapons, ATK circlets can be competitive to Crit ones, it also has a better drop rate, so don't throw away your good ATK circlets.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Primordial Jade Cutter](#weapon:primordial-jade-cutter)**<br>
With Blizzard Strayer (4) and Cryo Resonance, this weapon overcrits, so avoid getting Crit Rate substats.

**[Aquila Favonia](#weapon:aquila-favonia)**<br>
While Aquila Favonia has Physical Damage% as a main stat, which is basically useless on Ayaka, it is still a good statstick as it has a high base ATK and ATK% buff from the passive, however, it's not a huge upgrade over the other 4 star options and there might be a character which can utilize this weapon better (such as Bennett).

**[Skyward Blade](#weapon:skyward-blade)**<br>
The Energy Recharge main stat provided from this sword makes Ayaka comfortable in terms of having a good burst uptime, try to avoid getting Energy Recharge substats since the weapon already provides you with enough Energy Recharge.

**[Amenoma Kageuchi](#weapon:amenoma-kageuchi)**<br>
Lowers Ayaka's Energy Recharge requirement which allows her to allocate some of her Energy Recharge substats to other offensive substats. This weapon is also free and craftable while being competitive with other 4 star and even some 5 star weapons as well on the list.

**[Blackcliff Longsword](#weapon:blackcliff-longsword)**<br>
Due to Ayaka's burst snapshotting, her burst is unable to benefit from the ATK buff from this weapon's passive on the first rotation (since you cast it immediately before defeating an opponent).

**[Harbinger of Dawn](#weapon:harbinger-of-dawn)**<br>
A good Crit statstick if you can keep the requirements up (having >90% HP).

**[The Flute](#weapon:the-flute)**<br>
Offers slightly more damage potential than **Amenoma Kageuchi,** with the tradeoff being losing Kageuchi's energy generation. Decide for yourself which is better for your team and rotations.

# === characters.#ayato.roles.#dps.artifacts.notes ===

≈ Gladiator's Finale (4)


# === characters.#ayato.roles.#dps.tips ===

Try to activate Ayato's Elemental Burst before using his skill to maximize his Normal Attack DMG. Getting enough Energy Recharge for this is important, and varies based on team. Since the casting time is so long, it may not be worth snapshotting into buffs.

The amount of slashes Ayato can do during an Elemental Skill window is sometimes influenced by the player's set FPS.


# === characters.#ayato.roles.#dps.notes ===

DPS Ayato focuses on doing large amounts of on-field damage with his Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Skyward Blade](#weapon:skyward-blade) and [Amenoma Kageuchi](#weapon:amenoma-kageuchi)**<br>
If you are running Ayato in teams where he needs more than 140% ER to burst, these weapons can be quite valuable.

**[Summit Shaper](#weapon:summit-shaper)**<br>
In teams where ATK buffs are scarce, this weapon has the potential to rival The Black Sword.

**[Lion's Roar](#weapon:lions-roar)**<br>
In Electro-Charged teams, this weapon performs about equal to [The Black Sword](#weapon:the-black-sword).

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Echoes of an Offering (4)](#artifact:echoes-of-an-offering)**<br>
The performance of this artifact set is inconsistent, and is based on user ping and other factors. It is not recommended to run this set unless your ping is consistently below 100. If you can achieve this, Echoes is only preferred on weapons with high amounts of damage% such as Mistsplitters Reforged and Haran Geppaku Futsu. Otherwise, Heart of Depth (4) is preferred.

**[Blizzard Strayer (4)](#artifact:blizzard-strayer) when run in a Freeze Team**<br>
this is Ayato's best set. Note that it is not recommended to farm specifically for this set.

**[Thundering Fury (4)](#artifact:thundering-fury) when run in an Electro-Charged team**<br>
this is Ayato's best set due to the Cooldown Reduction on Elemental Skill allowing for shorter rotations. Note that it is not recommended to farm specifically for this set.

# === characters.#barbara.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/barbara/) from KQM

# === characters.#barbara.roles.#dps.name ===

dps


# === characters.#barbara.roles.#dps.tips ===

Due to her high stamina cost on charged attacks, her recommended attack strings for Vaporize playstyle is a mix of Charged attack spam and N2CJ (2 normal attacks followed by a charged attack cancelled with a jump animation).

In Electro-Charged teams, Barbara is expected to weave in attacks in between character swaps.


# === characters.#barbara.roles.#dps.notes ===

This section is dedicated to the playstyle where Barbara is triggering the vaporize reaction with her charged attack, for an Electro-Charged focused team, follow the weapon choices in the Support section instead.

For this playstyle, Barbara is heavily recommended to be run with Xiangling, as she is the only character that can keep up with Barbara's hydro application.

Always activate your skill first, as it reduces stamina consumption and if you have **\[C2\],** it will give 15% Hydro Damage Bonus.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Memory of Dust](#weapon:memory-of-dust)**<br>
This weapon requires stacks to be utilized, and in Vaporize DPS comps, you usually don't want to give up the first few Vaporize hits to stack up Memory of Dust's perk.

**Regarding Artifact sets**

**[Ocean-Hued Clam (4)](#artifact:ocean-hued-clam)**<br>
This is the best set to run in an Electro-Charged focused team, and in this scenario her mainstat choices should be optimised for healing instead of personal damage (HP%/HP%/Healing Bonus).


# === characters.#barbara.roles.#support.name ===

support

# === characters.#barbara.roles.#support.tips ===

Barbara's skill gives you a pulse of healing every 5 seconds, every pulse will imbue you with a Hydro status, that means it can be used for status-cleansing (Pyro in specific, while other elements may take more pulses).

Take note that Hydro reacting with Cryo status will freeze you in place, her skill should be used in consideration of the environment


# === characters.#barbara.roles.#support.notes ===

Use Elemental Skill and/or Elemental Burst and immediately switch. Building ER is not recommended on Support Barbara as her burst should be used as a last resort and should not be expected to be cast every rotation. This is further compounded by the fact that Barbara has no particle generation. For this reason, Ocean-Hued Clam is also not recommended for Support Barbara.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Everlasting Moonglow](#weapon:everlasting-moonglow)**<br>
For Electro-Charged teams, this weapon will provide the highest personal damage for Barbara. However, Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers will still provide the highest team damage due to its 48 ATK% buff.

**Regarding Artifact sets**

**[Maiden Beloved (4)](#artifact:maiden-beloved)**<br>
This is a very resin inefficient set and should not be intentionally farmed for.

**[Instructor (4)](#artifact:instructor)**<br>
The hydro application from Elemental Skill can be used to trigger an elemental reaction and provide a teamwide Elemental Mastery buff.

# === characters.#barbara.roles.#bloom_dps.name ===

bloom dps

# === characters.#barbara.roles.#bloom_dps.notes ===

This build is specifically for Bloom teams where Barbara is the character intended to trigger the majority of blooms.

**Regarding Aritfact Sets**

**[Ocean-Hued Clam (4)](#artifact:ocean-hued-clam)**
This set can do more damage than other options in certain situations, while also increasing Barbara's healing to deal with Bloom self-damage. However, this set is very resin inefficient and is thus not recommended to farm specifically for this set.

off-field dps


# === characters.#beidou.roles.#off-field_dps.subStats.notes ===

Prioritize Energy Recharge first if you can't burst off cooldown


# === characters.#beidou.roles.#off-field_dps.tips ===

Beidou's skill grants you an Electro status for a brief moment upon holding it. This means it can be used for status-cleansing (No particular effective element). Can only be done on herself.


# === characters.#beidou.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Serpent Spine](#weapon:serpent-spine)**<br>
Serpent Spine is a fine choice for sub-DPS Beidou and can outperform Wolf's Gravestone by a significant margin when Bennett/Sara ATK buffs are applied. Be sure to use Beidou in slot 1 to pre-stack Serpent Spine before starting an abyss floor.

**[Redhorn Stonethresher](#weapon:redhorn-stonethresher)**<br>
Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you're getting, this weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in personal damage.

**[Akuoumaru](#weapon:akuoumaru)**<br>
Assuming 260 team energy, Akuoumaru outperforms **Skyward Pride** on a **low ER requirement Beidou** (where she is paired with other Electro characters to battery her energy needs). At **\[R3+\],** it becomes exponentially better and comes very close to **Serpent Spine** and **Wolf's Gravestone.**

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Emblem of Severed Fate (4)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate)**<br>
Even after considering the 4-piece set effect, you should refrain from investing into **Energy Recharge** beyond what is needed to burst off cooldown as it will result in a **damage loss** as compared to prioritising offensive stats such as **ATK/Crit.** In team comps where Beidou has **low ER requirements** (i.e. when paired with electro batteries), a **Noblesse Oblige (2) / Thundering Fury (2) / +18% ATK set (2) \[Choose Two\]** will outperform **Emblem of Severed Fate (4).**

**[Thundersoother (4)](#artifact:thundersoother)**<br>
This set works best in an Electro-Charged or mono Electro comps.

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**<br>
This set could be considered if the team doesn't have a Noblesse Oblige (4) user, do note that sometimes Beidou doesn't benefit from the ATK buff from the 4 piece set if she's the set holder, so Beidou as a Noblesse Oblige (4) holder isn't really recommended.

# === characters.#bennett.roles.#dps.mainStats.notes ===

EM sands is generally > ATK%, but substat quality and weapon choice can potentially favour ATK% sands.


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#dps.subStats.notes ===

Elemental Mastery has lower priority than ATK% when using Iron Sting


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#dps.talents.notes ===

Normal Attack is only a priority if you have C6 Bennett


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#dps.tips ===

Bennett's EB grants you a pyro status as long as your characters are within his burst AoE (Cryo in specific, since Pyro > Cryo).

For that, cast EB with Bennett, switch to the character imbued with Cryo and walk on Bennett's Burst field

Upon entering burst field, the Pyro status will continuously imbue you with Pyro, reacting with other elements on you and eventually removing them.


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#dps.notes ===


**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[The Black Sword](#weapon:the-black-sword)**
With the EM sand, this combo has the highest Melt/Vaporize damage. <br>

**[Iron Sting](#weapon:iron-sting)**
This weapon at \[R1\] with EM sand turns out to have diminishing returns and isn't as good, but \[R2+\] Iron Sting is a different question because better buffs.<br>

**[Aquila Favonia](#weapon:aquila-favonia)**
Assuming you have a high investment build's CR/CD stats, this weapon with EM sands will be better than the two above.<br>

**[Primordial Jade Cutter](#weapon:primordial-jade-cutter)**
With [Thundering Fury (4)](#artifact:thundering-fury), this weapon is able to out-perform [Mistsplitter Reforged](#weapon:mistsplitter-reforged) due to massive Crit Rate% substat, which allows consistent vaporize damage despite the lack of Crit Rate/DMG substats, assuming that your EM Sands/Circlet lacks crit rate substats. However, in the rare occasion that your EM pieces manage to roll plenty of Crit subs, Mistsplitter easily overtakes the Jade Cutter.

**[The Alley Flash](#weapon:the-alley-flash)** 
Has the potential to beat [Iron Sting](#weapon:iron-sting) \[R5\], but this requires the passive to be up, whenever damaged, your passive is disabled for 5 seconds and you could be losing out a lot of damage, especially if you are constantly being damaged.


**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Crimson Witch of Flames (4)](#artifact:crimson-witch-of-flames)<br>
Assuming a Melt/Vaporize team, this set is your best set for damage and works best with Chongyun on the same team for consistent Melt.

[Thundering Fury (4)](#artifact:thundering-fury)<br>
This set works best if paired with Electro supports such as Beidou and Fischl/Lisa, as it allows Bennett to:
1) Rapidly spam E for raw pyro damage and application, allowing frequent Overload reaction triggers and breaking Electro shields rapidly.<br>
2) Generate tons of energy for the entire team. <br>
The setup is generally only recommended for those with Beidou \[C2/C6\].<br>
The main-stat artifacts you want to farm for Thundering Fury (4) Bennett varies from the main-stat artifacts you'd normally go for the other builds. Instead of ATK%/EM, Pyro and Crit, you'd instead want to go for EM, Pyro and EM on a Thundering Fury (4) Bennett. As such, this also means weapons that have EM substats such as Iron Sting take priority over other swords.

Recommended amount of ER%: 130-150%. <br>
With Thundering Fury (4), you have a lot more leeway when it comes to ER.

Recommended amount of ER%: 180-200


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#burst_support.notes ===

A Burst Support Bennett **completely ignores the need for excess healing potential** and is aimed for people who prefer to squeeze out more damage instead. On this build, Bennett is built with offensive stats like ATK%, Pyro Damage, and Crit stats while having a good amount of Energy Recharge to burst off cooldown.<br>
**Prioritize Energy Recharge before offensive stats if you cannot cast your Elemental Burst off cooldown.**


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#support.name ===

# === characters.#bennett.roles.#support.mainStats.notes ===

Main stats aren't as important. Stack Energy Recharge for comfortable Elemental Burst uptime instead.


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#support.tips ===

Recommended amount of ER%: 200+


# === characters.#bennett.roles.#support.notes ===

**Heals** from his Elemental Burst scale off of **HP,** while his **damage buff** from Burst only scales with your **base ATK (Character Base ATK stat and Weapon Base ATK stat)**

**DO NOT increase Bennett's constellation from 5 to 6** unless he is in a Pyro team and you know what you're doing. This is because Bennett **turns all of your melee on-field character's Auto Attacks into Pyro,** which means that Bennett will lose a lot of his team comp potential.

Although Bennett is usually considered a healer, he already heals a lot even without necessarily building for HP%, **if you find it unnecessary to build for HP%, you can consider building him as a Burst Support.**

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Mistsplitter Reforged](#weapon:mistsplitter-reforged), [Aquila Favonia](#weapon:aquila-favonia)<br>
These weapons have the highest Base ATK in the game which is why it is ranked quite high. It is assuming you have enough Energy Recharge so you still can burst off cooldown for the maximum ATK buff.

[Freedom-Sworn](#weapon:freedom-sworn)<br>
In comps where Bennett can reliably trigger reactions (and thus trigger this sword's passive), the buffs provided by this weapon will be stronger than Aquila Favonia.

[The Alley Flash](#weapon:the-alley-flash)<br>
This weapon currently has the highest Base ATK for a 4 star weapon (even more Base ATK than some 5 stars like Skyward Blade).

[Prototype Rancour](#weapon:prototype-rancour)<br>
This weapon has one of the highest Base ATK for a 4 Star weapon (and this is also a weapon you could craft from the Blacksmith)

Crit Rate only if running Favonius Lance


# === characters.#candace.roles.#support.notes ===

Candace has generally poor personal damage, and as such performs best as a low investment support.


# === characters.#chongyun.roles.#burst_support.name ===

burst support


# === characters.#chongyun.roles.#burst_support.tips ===

Chongyun's Elemental Burst is calculated as Claymore damage, which means it breaks Geo Structures/ Shields at a much easier rate and can proc shatter.


# === characters.#chongyun.roles.#burst_support.notes ===

It is preferred to use Chongyun as a Sub DPS/ Nuke over Main DPS as **his Normal Attack scalings are very low,** even when including Constellation 1. His **Elemental Burst on the other hand hits extremely hard** on later constellations and takes a much higher total damage portion over his Normal Attack. On top of that, you can Reverse Melt all 3 hits of his Elemental Burst on enemies applied with strong Pyro, such as Bennett's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst.

Chongyun is **very niche** as he only performs well in certain teams and can completely destroy the other. He is mainly used on a team as an **enabler,** be it for **Reverse Melt teams** (e.g. Melt DPS Bennett) or **Freeze teams** (e.g. Freeze DPS Kaeya). He also **does not function well with Physical teams** (e.g. Razor, Eula) as it renders his Elemental Skill useless because it converts their **Normal Attack damage from Physical to Cryo.** They're usually using a Physical Goblet, so if they got their Normal Attack converted from Physical to Cryo, **they won't benefit from Physical DMG Bonus** from the goblet, thus it's a DPS loss.

At **\[C2\],** his Elemental Skill **reduces ability cooldown that is casted within the zone by 15%.** This is one of the few abilities in the game that can reduce cooldown.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Serpent Spine](#weapon:serpent-spine)<br>
This weapon outperforms [Wolf's Gravestone](#weapon:wolfs-gravestone) if we only look at Chongyun's damage contribution **\[5 Stack Assumed\].** [Wolf's Gravestone](#weapon:wolfs-gravestone) is ranked higher as it provides more teamwide DPS and does not come with the need to acquire stacks before engaging in combat.

[Redhorn Stonethresher](#weapon:redhorn-stonethresher)<br>
Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you're getting, this weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in personal damage.

[Akuoumaru](#weapon:akuoumaru)<br>
At **\[R1\], Akuoumaru** beats [Luxurious Sea-Lord](#weapon:luxurious-sea-lord) if Chongyun is used in a team with **260 or greater** total team energy. [Akuoumaru](#weapon:akuoumaru) only beats [Luxurious Sea-Lord](#weapon:luxurious-sea-lord) if **\[R2\]** and above otherwise.

[Sacrificial Greatsword](#weapon:sacrificial-greatsword)<br>
This weapon is your best choice if faced in a situation where you heavily rely on Chongyun's Cryo infusion uptime.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)<br>
Chongyun is one of the best Noblesse holders since he has low energy requirements for his Elemental Burst.

**Regarding Talent Priority**

Prioritize Elemental Burst on a Melt team as it scales better than his Elemental Skill.<br>
Prioritize Elemental Skill on a Freeze team to furthermore extend the duration of the Cryo infusion.

# === characters.#collei.roles.#support.mainStats.notes ===

Prioritize Energy Recharge if her Energy Requirements are not met.


# === characters.#collei.roles.#support.tips ===

**Typical Collei Rotation** <br>
Skill > Burst > Swap<br>

**Rotation with [Polar Star](#weapon:polar-star)**<br>
N1 > tap Charged Attack > Skill > Burst > Swap

**Energy Recharge Guidelines** <br>
160–200% (Depending on Team and weapon)


# === characters.#collei.roles.#support.notes ===

Collei is a Bow User who provides off-field support in Dendro application and damage.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**<br>

**[Polar Star](#weapon:polar-star)**<br>
While this weapon provides the highest personal damage, it is generally not recommended as team buffs provide more teamwide damage over a small increase in personal damage. 

**[Sacrificial Bow](#weapon:sacrificial-bow)**<br>
Not recommended below R4 due to it delaying rotation, possibly resulting in damage loss.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**<br>

**[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
Collei's Sprout damage counts as Skill damage, which allows her to be able to keep Tenacity of the Millelith up during important damage windows. Generally an alternative to [Noblesse](#artifact:noblesse-oblige) or [Deepwood](#artifact:deepwood-memories) (or if you are already running both in a team).<br>

**[Gilded Dreams (4)](#artifact:gilded-dreams)**<br>
This set is only used in a team where Collei is used to trigger reactions (i.e. Bloom/Burning teams), and does not benefit Collei if she is used as an aura.

**[The Exile (4)](#artifact:the-exile)**<br>
An alternative option if they are placed in the same team as Cyno to help his Energy Recharge needs.

**Rotations:**

**Non-TF: E**Q N3E N5E N5 N2E N5 N2E - 3 Endseer<br>
EQ N3E N5E N5 N2E N5 N2E N5 N2E - 4 Endseer

**4pc TF: E**Q N2E N4E N4E N5E N4E N4E - 3 Endseer<br>

EQ N2E N4E N4E N5E N4E N4E N4E N4E - 4 Endseer Option 2


# === characters.#cyno.roles.#dps.notes ===

Cyno is a DPS character that uses his burst to change stance and deal electro damage. The damage dealt during this stance is normal attack damage so burst damage buffs will not affect him. On most teams with an electro battery, he will want 120–150% energy recharge.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Kitain Cross Spear](#weapon:kitain-cross-spear)**
This weapon is especailly competitive with the options higher on the list if Cyno is not being run with an electro battery.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Thundering Fury (4)](#artifact:thundering-fury)**
In optimal conditions, this is Cyno's best artifact set. This set is an especially competitive option when Cyno is the only Electro character in the team, as the extra Elemental Skill casts help alleviate his energy issues. Do note that casting his skill off cooldown with this set might lead to missing Endseer stance windows and losing overall damage. It is highly recommended to use a shielder with Cyno with this set.

**[Gilded Dreams (4)](#artifact:gilded-dreams)**
This artifact set is better than Gladiator's Finale on [Staff of the Scarlet Sands](#weapon:staff-of-the-scarlet-sands) and [White Tassel](#weapon:white-tassel).

**[Thundersoother (4)](#artifact:thundersoother)**
If you can guarantee 100% uptime on this set, it performs better than [Gladiator's Finale (4)](#artifact:gladiators-finale). However, satifying this condition is infeasible on most teams.

**Regarding Main Stat Choices**

**Sands**
Elemental Mastery versus Attack is heavily dependant on the weapon and team Cyno is in. It is recommended to test each and/or consult an optimizer.<br>

**Circlet**
With [Staff of the Scarlet Sands](#weapon:staff-of-the-scarlet-sands), Elemental Mastery may be used as the circlet mainstat.

# === characters.#diluc.roles.#dps.name ===

dps


# === characters.#diluc.roles.#dps.weapons.notes ===

Assumptions are important for this ranking. Please check notes for relevant weapons.


# === characters.#diluc.roles.#dps.subStats.advices.2.notes ===

higher prio in Vaporize/Melt comps


# === characters.#diluc.roles.#dps.talents.notes ===

Worth noting that Diluc's constellations boost his Elemental Skill's damage, so talent prioritization can vary from player to player


# === characters.#diluc.roles.#dps.tips ===

Diluc has a number of combos he can do during his uptime. <br>
N = Normal Attack, E = Elemental Skill, Q = Elemental Burst (N2 would equal 2 Normal Attacks)<br>
His most common combo is Q N2 E N2 E N2 E. This fits perfectly into the buff window of his teams.

For high upfront damage, use Q E N1 E N1 E N1. This falls off significantly if the enemy isn't killed within this window.

A full rotation combo can look similar to Q N2 E N2 E N2 E N4 N3 E N1 E E. An example video can be found [here.](https://youtu.be/wDzOoHiMpbs)


# === characters.#diluc.roles.#dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**
These placements assume strong ATK buffs such as Bennett, as Diluc is commonly played with them present in his party.

[Redhorn Stonethresher](#weapon:redhorn-stonethresher)<br>
This weapon falls off considerably when strong ATK buffs are not present, still being a top tier option but similar in power to the weapons ranked directly below.

[Serpent Spine](#weapon:serpent-spine)<br>
This placement assumes you can maintain high stacks of the weapon effect. If you find yourself being hit often, a low-stacked Serpent Spine will find itself falling significantly in potential. This weapon scales well with refinements, having the potential to be Diluc's best weapon.<br>

[The Unforged](#weapon:the-unforged)<br>
This weapon matches [Wolf's Gravestone](#weapon:wolfs-gravestone) while shielded. While unshielded, it loses some potency but is still a strong weapon tied with a low refined Rainslasher.<br>

[Rainslasher](#weapon:rainslasher)<br>
This weapon should only be used in teams where Diluc is consistently Vaporising his attacks. This weapon scales well with refinements, potentially surpassing [Wolf's Gravestone](#weapon:wolfs-gravestone) at \[R5\].

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Crimson Witch of Flames (4)](#artifact:crimson-witch-of-flames)<br>
Generally the best go to set for Diluc due to how easily Diluc can stack the Pyro Damage effect, while his burst imbues his Normal/Charged Attacks with Pyro.

[Gladiator's Finale (4)](#artifact:gladiators-finale)<br>
For those who are still reluctant on farming for Crimson Witch of Flames (Pre-AR 45), this will still provide a fairly decent increase in DPS as a large portion of his damage is tied into his Normal Attack talent.

**Regarding Main Stats Priority**

If Diluc is run alongside Xingqiu where he can trigger Vaporize very often, he can run EM sands as an alternative to ATK sands as EM boosts Diluc's reaction damage significantly.


# === characters.#diona.roles.#support.name ===

support


# === characters.#diona.roles.#support.tips ===

Diona's Elemental Skill grants you a cryo shield which allows cleansing. Every time you swap characters with the shield up, it applies cryo. This acts as a cleanse.


# === characters.#diona.roles.#support.notes ===

The shielding Diona puts out should offset the need for healing from her burst. The damage boost from Noblesse Oblige (4) has more practical use. Additionally, her first constellation greatly increases her ultimate uptime, further lowering the healing needed.

As a support, Diona's typically used for three things; Shielding, Healing, and Cryo particle generation. Pairing Diona with Cryo carries such as Ganyu and Eula allows you to funnel energy into your DPS characters while providing them with quick shields for stagger resistance. Weapons such as Sacrificial Bow and Favonius Warbow greatly increase her potential as a battery.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Sacrificial Bow](#weapon:sacrificial-bow)**<br>
Prefered over Favonius at higher refinements for consistency and when batterying another cryo unit.

**[Favonius Warbow](#weapon:favonius-warbow)**<br>
It is recommended to build some Crit Rate  coverage to have a higher chance of triggering bow passive for energy.

**[Recurve Bow](#weapon:recurve-bow)**<br>
This bow will be your best choice for stronger shields, but it reduces Diona's burst uptime significantly due to having no Energy Recharge on her weapon.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**<br>
This set provides an atk buff while also increasing burst damage - this set is usually used with healers because you want to use damage sets on other support units such as Xingqiu or Beidou.

**[Emblem of Severed Fate (2) ](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate)+ [Tenacity of the Milellith (2)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
Provides both ER and HP which are both valuable for a support diona, increasing ult uptime and healing strength respectively.

**Regarding Main Stat Priority**

Full Stack HP% is recommended if you want stronger shields but a weaker heal. You can use Healing Bonus Circlet if you want a nice balance between the two.

**Regarding Talent Priority**

Prioritise whichever your Diona is geared for (shielder or healer), if built for a balance between the two, level both equally.

# === characters.#dori.roles.#support.name ===

# === characters.#dori.roles.#support.mainStats.notes ===

A Crit Rate Circlet can be considered if running [Favonius Greatsword](#weapon:favonius-greatsword)


# === characters.#dori.roles.#support.subStats.notes ===

Crit Rate is useful only when using [Favonius Greatsword](#weapon:favonius-greatsword)


# === characters.#dori.roles.#support.tips ===

It is generally advised to use 2 elemental skills per burst rotation, as this helps to alleviate her otherwise extreme Energy requirements. 


# === characters.#dori.roles.#support.notes ===

Dori is mainly a support character that provides Healing and Energy to a teammate through her burst.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Sacrificial Greatsword](#weapon:sacrificial-greatsword)**
This weapon's passive allows Dori to cast her elemental skill twice while only swapping to her once per rotation.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Deepwood Memories (4)](#artifact:deepwood-memories)**
This set should only be used when Dori is in a dendro based team composition.



# === characters.#eula.roles.#dps.name ===

dps


# === characters.#eula.roles.#dps.tips ===

**Normal combo while no Burst**<br>
NA Spam > Tap Skill > NA Spam > Tap Skill

**Burst combo**<br>
Tap Skill > Burst > 4 NA > Hold Skill > 4 NA

**Burst combo that generates more energy at the cost of slightly less DPS**<br>
Tap Skill > Burst > Tap Skill > 4 NA > Dash Cancel > 2 NA > Hold Skill > 2 NA

**\*NA = Normal Attack**


# === characters.#eula.roles.#dps.notes ===

Eula's weapon rankings assume that you're running her with a Cryo battery (i.e. Diona) instead of Bennett. She would usually need 30%-60%+ Energy Recharge from substats depending on what team and Cryo batteries you use.

Eula's Elemental Burst does not snapshot. This means that any buffs Eula has upon casting Burst will not be taken into effect if the buff duration expires before the Lightfall Sword hits.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Redhorn Stonethresher](#weapon:redhorn-stonethresher)<br>
This weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in terms of Eula's own damage if team provides enough ATK% buffs, but Wolf's Gravestone can make up the damage difference by buffing team damage.

[Skyward Pride](#weapon:skyward-pride)<br>
This weapon is more forgiving towards ER substats. If there is a Cryo battery unit in your team (Diona with Sacrificial Bow or Kaeya with Favonius Sword) or if your team generates enough particles on their own, Skyward Pride loses effectiveness compared to the above options.

[Akuoumaru](#weapon:akuoumaru)<br>
This weapon will outperform Luxurious Sea Lord at higher refinements.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Pale Flame (4)](#artifact:pale-flame)<br>
This is Eula's optimal artifact set and it relies on having a condition fulfilled in order to outperform Pale Flame (2) Bloodstained Chivalry (2). If you are able to sustain the conditional buff, you will be able to achieve a 50% Physical DMG Bonus + 18% ATK. Without using your Elemental Burst, you can sustain the Pale Flame's 4 piece set bonus because each stack lasts 7s and it refreshes per stack, and Eula's Elemental Skill cooldown is only 4 seconds when doing 1-taps, therefore you can keep the condition up. When using this set, it is recommended to not use Hold Skill cast until your Lightfall Sword is nearly about to end. This restriction is only for players who don't have Eula **\[C2+\].** Please visit the Ability Tips for her combo.

[Pale Flame (2)](#artifact:pale-flame) + [Bloodstained Chivalry (2)](#artifact:bloodstained-chivalry)<br>
This is a non-conditional, consistent artifact set that provides you a constant 50% Physical DMG bonus. While that by itself is amazing, Pale Flame (4) can outperform this set because it also has another 18% ATK buff and is easily maintained through her low tap skill cooldown.

# === characters.#faruzan.roles.#support.name ===

support


# === characters.#faruzan.roles.#support.subStats.notes ===

Only assumes higher priority than Crit DMG when using Favonius Warbow


# === characters.#faruzan.roles.#support.tips ===

**Regarding Optimal Rotations**

**For funneling particles to Faruzan**<br>
Skill --> Charged Shot --> Burst

**For funneling particles to other units**<br>
Skill --> Burst --> Charged Shot

At C6 bear in mind the Charged shot portion of the rotation no longer becomes necessary since your burst will start activating the Pressurized Collapses instead.


# === characters.#faruzan.roles.#support.notes ===

As the premier Anemo support unit for Anemo dps based teams, Faruzan combines both high Anemo damage buffing with Anemo resistance shredding to become a cornerstone of any team that wants to focus on Anemo damage. Though building her means primarly focusing on dealing with her high energy requirements.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Elegy for the End](#weapon:elegy-for-the-end)**
Usually only a better option at higher constellation levels such as \[C6\] where her energy needs can be met without Favonius passive particles.

**[Sacrificial Bow](#weapon:sacrificial-bow)**
It's worth mentioning that the extra Pressurized Collapse from a second E** wont give you any extra particles if it's within her 5.5 second particle generation cooldown.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**
This is her best option in teams that either wont benefit significantly from [Viridescent Venerer (4)](#artifact:viridescent-venerer) shred, or teams that already have another unit holding the aforementioned set.

**[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**
This has similar usage cases to Noblesse Oblige except in that it requires Faruzan C6 for improved uptime through extra Pressurized Collapse activations.

**Emblem of Severed Fate (4)**
This set will give Faruzan her best personal damage output, assuming the team is already running Viridescent Venerer. Also if you're willing to invest more time farming substats it can potentially give you more Energy Recharge than running The Exile (2).



# === characters.#fischl.roles.#dps.name ===

dps


# === characters.#fischl.roles.#dps.tips ===

Courtesy of _paraszcazk#0148_

Due to how Polar Star works, your optimal rotation would be different from other weapons:

**Skill (Burst) > NA > CA > Resummon Oz (To snapshot Polar Star stacks)**


# === characters.#fischl.roles.#dps.notes ===

\[C1\] is recommended to even start Fischl's DPS build, with Oz still contributing to Physical DPS even when he's off-field.

There is an animation cancelling technique with Fischl DPS. After 3 or 5 basic attacks, shoot an Aim Shot to reset your attack combo. The faster you can do this, the better it is. Only use this for animation cancelling when you're out of stamina since it can be pretty hard to replicate consistently.

**Regarding \[C6\] Fischl Build**

At **\[C6\],** Oz will be dealing about 60% of the DPS and it'd be better to invest on **+18% ATK set (2) Thundering Fury (2)** until you can obtain **Pale Flame (4)** with an Electro Goblet.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Skyward Harp ](#weapon:skyward-harp)and [Polar Star](#weapon:polar-star)**<br>
Due to the aforementioned Electro/Phys split at **\[C6\], Polar Star** will surpass **Skyward Harp.**

**[Viridescent Hunt](#weapon:the-viridescent-hunt)**<br>
This weapon is a really good investment that even surpasses Amos in a situation where there are crowds of enemies, although it's not as efficient towards massive single targets or really agile targets. It offers crowd DPS that is severely lacking due to Fischl's single target attacks.

**[Mitternachts Waltz](#weapon:mitternachts-waltz)**<br>
This weapon would be prioritized over Amos if you manage to get \[R5\] for pure Physical build Fischl.

**[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)**<br>
If you manage to weave in a Charged Shot on enemy weak spots once every 9-10 seconds, Prototype Crescent could potentially offer more DPS, this weapon can be an option for those interested in a more challenging playstyle.


# === characters.#fischl.roles.#off-field_dps.name ===

off-field dps


# === characters.#fischl.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

Elemental Burst and Skill both summon Oz, so make sure you're only using one at a time. Start with your Skill, use Burst for second Oz rotation and alternate. Hopefully, by the time your second/third round of Oz summoning is over, you'll have gained enough energy to repeat the loop.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

In general, Fischl's rankings depend significantly on the refinements of her weapons. For more detailed numbers, see the Google Sheet [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YONq2v20Gn7immi87akhcJyAT74aUo96941zWTwSup0/edit#gid=41671389)

[Alley Hunter](#weapon:alley-hunter)
At \[R5\] this weapon can be similar in performance to [Skyward Harp](#weapon:skyward-harp) and [Thundering Pulse](#weapon:thundering-pulse).

[The Stringless](#weapon:the-stringless)
At \[R5\] this weapon can be stronger than [Amos' Bow](#weapon:amos-bow), [Alley Hunter](#weapon:alley-hunter) \[R1\] and The [Viridescent Hunt](#weapon:the-viridescent-hunt). This difference is enlarged in teams where Fischl can find herself triggering reactions.

**[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)**
If you can consistently hit a weakpoint on an enemy before summoning Oz, this weapon performs better than [Fading Twilight](#weapon:fading-twilight).

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Thundersoother (4)](#artifact:thundersoother)**<br>
This artifact set will outperform +18% ATK set(2) Thundering Fury(2) if used in a team comp where an electro aura is always present (e.g. Electro/Electro-charged comps) therefore it is *ighly recommended within this niche.

**[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
This set trades off a portion of Fischl's damage in return for a party wide 20% ATK buff. If you have good pieces as a result of farming Pale Flame (for Eula or otherwise) this can be a good option for her in specific teams. Fischl can benefit from the 20% ATK buff herself if she summons Oz within 3 seconds of his previous attack. Not recommended to specifically farm this set for Fischl.

# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#melt_dps.name ===

melt dps

# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#melt_dps.artifacts.notes ===

≈ Wanderer's Troupe (4)\*

# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#melt_dps.tips ===

In some teams and situations, using Ganyu's Elemental Burst can be detrimental to overall damage due to stealing Pyro aura, thus reducing the amount of CAs melting.


# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#melt_dps.notes ===

Ganyu's Level 2 Charged Shot applies two instances Cryo as they do not share the same ICD, which allows you to trigger Melt reaction twice for both damage instances. Charged Attack will be the majority of her damage output while neglecting her Skill/Burst damage contribution for most scenarios.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Amos' Bow](#weapon:amos-bow)<br>
Amos is an excellent weapon for Ganyu since her Level 2 Charge Shot Bloom extends arrow flight duration and you can get 3 stacks of Amos' passive even on point blank range.

[Hamayumi](#weapon:hamayumi)<br>
Due to its passive, this weapon prefers [Wanderer's Troupe (4)](#artifact:wanderers-troupe)

[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)<br>
At higher refinement levels with good uptime on its passive, it can potentially be on par with [Skyward Harp](#weapon:skyward-harp). However, do bear in mind that not all enemies have weak spots that you can headshot, which does affect its performance significantly.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**<br>

**[Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4)](#artifact:shimenawas-reminiscence) and [Wanderer's Troupe (4)](#artifact:wanderers-troupe)**<br>
Shimenawa's only pulls ahead if you are able to squeeze 5 Charged Attacks during the 10 second buff duration. Due to it being very difficult to do, Wanderer's Troupe (4) will usually end up dealing more damage for most players. Note that unless you intend to artifact strongbox Wanderer's Troupe pieces, Shimenawa's Riminiscence remains the better set to farm as the domain is greatly resin efficient.

**Regarding Talent Priority**

Ganyu's Elemental Burst is low priority on a Melt Build since most of the times, you don't cast her burst at all so that it doesn't steal your Melt reaction.


# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#freeze_dps.name ===

freeze dps


# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#freeze_dps.tips ===

Try to not overcap on Crit Rate (within the range of 25%-45% Crit Rate) since Ganyu's A1 passive only affects her Charged Shot and subsequent Blooms.


# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#freeze_dps.notes ===

Freeze Ganyu gives a lot of i-frames since you would be spamming Elemental Burst from all of your party members off cooldown. Ganyu's Elemental Burst can deal a ton of damage based on how grouped the enemies are, due to the quadratic scaling on her Elemental Burst.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Polar Star](#weapon:polar-star)**<br>
This weapon is much harder to optimize with, due to having a very high Crit Rate stat resulting in your Crit Rate going well above 100%. However, if optimised properly **(i.e. very little Crit Rate substats),** it pulls quite far ahead of all the other options.

**[Aqua Simulacra](#weapon:aqua-simulacra)**<br> 
Due to the sheer amount of Crit stats you can get from Blizzard Strayer (4), Ganyu's ascension passive and this weapon itself, you can consider running an ATK% circlet, especially if it has better substats than your Crit DMG one.

**[Amos' Bow](#weapon:amos-bow)**<br>
In quickswap heavy rotations (Ganyu Mona Venti Diona) where you usually don't do a lot of Charged Shots, this weapon performs worse than the other 5 star options listed.

**[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)**<br>
Similar to the Melt Build, this weapon at higher refinement levels and good passive uptime can pull ahead of some of the 5 star options such as [Thundering Pulse](#weapon:thundering-pulse) and [Skyward Harp](#weapon:skyward-harp). However, do bear in mind that not all enemies have weak spots that you can headshot, which does affect its performance significantly.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Blizzard Strayer (4)](#artifact:blizzard-strayer)**<br>
This set is the go to set for a Frozen team comp due to the huge stats it provides.

on a non Freeze comp


# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#off-field_dps.tips ===

When using her Elemental Burst, place her Elemental Skill in the AoE to taunt and keep enemies inside the zone for constant damage.

Make sure to hit enemies with her skill's initial damage and her explosion damage as they both regen energy for her ult.


# === characters.#ganyu.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

An Off-field DPS Ganyu shines brightly on a Freeze comp as she has 100% Elemental Burst uptime and her Elemental Burst buffs party members' Cryo Damage.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)<br>
This weapon might pull ahead of some of the other options if you activate the buff before casting Elemental Burst.

[Elegy for the End](#weapon:elegy-for-the-end)<br>
Offers party-wide Elemental Mastery and ATK buff which is quite nice on reaction heavy team comps.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Blizzard Strayer (4)](#artifact:blizzard-strayer)<br>
This set offers a huge amount of stats, use this set only if your Ganyu is used on a Freeze team.

[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)<br>
This set provides Ganyu with more utility so that she can buff your whole party's ATK by 20%.


# === characters.#gorou.roles.#support.name ===

support


# === characters.#gorou.roles.#support.tips ===

**\[C2\]** extends the duration of Gorou's Elemental Burst from 9 seconds to 12 seconds if you can obtain the required Crystallize shields. This allows his teammates to gain the 3 Geo 15% Geo DMG% bonus for a longer duration, so it's preferable to use Burst as your last ability before swapping into your DPS.


# === characters.#gorou.roles.#support.notes ===

Gorou is a Support character that can give increasing buffs to your party members from his Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst based on the number of Geo characters in your team (capped at 3). Casting his Elemental Skill sets up a banner which gives flat DEF (1 Geo), Interruption Resistance (2 Geo) and Geo DMG% Bonus (3 Geo) for your active character standing inside the banner radius. Casting his Elemental Burst creates a field following the active character which deals periodic damage and offers the same bonuses given by the Skill, destroying any placed banners in the process, it also pulls in nearby Elemental Shards created by Crystallize reactions. Due to his kit focusing on buffing DEF and Geo DMG, he's a specialised support geared towards Geo DPS that scales with DEF, such as Noelle or Itto. He can see niche use at **\[C6\]** with other Geo characters as well.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Elegy for the End](#weapon:elegy-for-the-end)<br>
Elegy offers a helpful ER substat alongside an EM and ATK% buff for your teammates. While not directly useful in teams centered around Noelle or Itto, this could possibly be a good choice for future Geo DPS characters, or in a team which utilizes Geo Resonance.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[The Exile (4)](#artifact:the-exile)<br>
Casting Elemental Burst regenerates a total of 6 Energy for each of your party member. This set reduces your Energy Requirements by a bit for all of your party members, which can be quite beneficial. Do note that this is a 4 star set so you're potentially missing out on 5 star stat scaling, which is a 34% difference in mainstat value and 25% difference in individual substat value.

[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)<br>
The effectiveness of this set increases if you've already met the ER requirement for Gorou. At that point, you'd no longer need to run the recommended ER% sets, which means you can opt for this instead.

**Regarding Artifact Mainstats and Substats Priority**

**DEF% mainstats and substats** (and potentially a **Healing Bonus** mainstat on Circlet) can be considered at **\[C4\]** due to being able to heal the active character based on his DEF during burst. This is useful if you plan to use him as a solo healer.

**Crit Rate circlet and substats** can be considered when Gorou is using Favonius Warbow to trigger the passive comfortably.

**ER% substats can usually be more important than getting the right mainstat,** as Gorou's damage contribution to a team is negligible, while being able to get Energy for his Burst is a lot more important.

# === characters.#hu-tao.roles.#dps.tips ===

When ending Hu Tao's combos with an Elemental Burst, if you do not jump/dash cancel the last charged attack, the Elemental Burst will still benefit from Hu Tao's Elemental Skill.

**cancels** when performing your Hu Tao combos as to maximize damage.<br>
**N2CJ** for **\[C0\]** and **N2CD** for **\[C1\].**<br>
**N3CJ/N3CD** can be used to conserve stamina at the cost of damage.

**\*N = Normal Attack, C = Charged Attack, J = Jump, D = Dash**


# === characters.#hu-tao.roles.#dps.notes ===

Hu Tao is most effective when used with Xingqiu to proc Vaporize/Freeze Melt reactions which utilizes her BiS Set, Crimson Witch of Flames (4). Freeze Melt refers to freezing enemies for Melt set up, since unlike Diluc or Klee, Hu Tao doesn't shatter frozen enemies.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Primordial Jade Winged-Spear](#weapon:primordial-jade-winged-spear)<br>
Is better than the \[R1\] variants of [Dragon's Bane](#weapon:dragons-bane) and [Deathmatch](#weapon:deathmatch) with ideal stacking. While this is a very strong weapon when fully stacked, maintaining the stacks on Hu Tao isn't ideal in realistic situations making the weapon less consistent than other options.

[Deathmatch](#weapon:deathmatch)<br>
Deathmatch is better than Dragon's Bane when you're not doing Vaporize.

[Blackcliff Pole](#weapon:blackcliff-pole)<br>
Despite seeming quite good due to the Crit DMG substat, Blackcliff at 1 stack performs only slightly better than an **\[R5\]** White Tassel in practice as it is difficult to maintain stacks consistently. It is not recommended to buy this weapon specifically for Hu Tao and should only be used if you already have one.

[Vortex Vanquisher](#weapon:vortex-vanquisher) and [Skyward Spine](#weapon:skyward-spine)<br>
Provides little to nothing to Hu Tao since she scales better with HP% than ATK% with every spear in the game. **Base ATK makes little difference on Hu Tao because she has a very high HP to ATK conversion cap.**

[White Tassel](#weapon:white-tassel)<br>
White Tassel requires your combos to be more focused on Normal Attacks (N2C over N1C) to make use of it's passive.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4)](#artifact:shimenawas-reminiscence)<br>
Provides higher AA damage than 4CW but lowers your Elemental Burst damage which hurts your AoE damage, also if you're unable to burst, it might cause survivability issues if you're not running a healer.

[Retracing Bolide (4)](#artifact:retracing-bolide) **and** [Wanderer's Troupe ](#artifact:wanderers-troupe)**/**[ Tenacity of the Millelith (2) ](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**+**80 EM set (2)
All these options are almost on equal footing because both of the sets have an equal overall damage output assuming you have 100% shield uptime when using Bolide (4). The difference is, you want to use Wanderer's Troupe / Tenacity of the Millelith (2) + Crimson's Witch of Flame (2) when focusing on Nuking and better consistency, while 4 Bolide is for overall higher AA damage at the expense of lower burst damage, although inconsistent if you cannot keep your shield permanently.

**Regarding Artifact Substats Priority**

Since Hu Tao is able to trigger Vaporize on most of her damage output, Elemental Mastery is quite valuable on her. If you have less than 100EM total (including from Sucrose EM share, 4pc Instructor, etc) EM substat take priority over Crit Rate / DMG.


# === characters.#itto.roles.#dps.name ===

dps


# === characters.#itto.roles.#dps.notes ===

Arataki Itto is a Geo DPS Character who takes advantage of his Elemental Burst's ATK boost and Geo infusion to deal significant damage during its uptime. His combos involve stacking and unleashing his Charged Attacks, named Arataki Kesagiri. Arataki Kesagiri consumes no stamina and can be casted continuously as long as he has Superlative Superstrength stacks. Superlative Superstrength is capped at 5 stacks at any given time, and Itto gets those stacks when his 2nd and 4th Normal Attack string hits an enemy. Activating his Elemental Burst allows his 1st and 3rd Normal Attack to also generate stacks.

Itto's Elemental Skill deals damage to enemies on cast and summons a taunt, Ushi, which is considered a Geo Construct. This initial cast damage grants Itto 1 Superlative Superstrength stack, and upon Ushi leaving the field, Itto is granted another stack. When Ushi takes damage, Itto gains a stack (capped at 1 stack per 2 seconds). Itto's Elemental Burst converts his Normal and Charged Attacks into Geo DMG, increases Itto's Normal Attack Speed and converts a portion of Itto's current DEF to ATK.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Serpent Spine](#weapon:serpent-spine)<br>
When [using Husk of Opulent Dreams](#artifact:husk-of-opulent-dreams), Serpent Spine stacks are prioritized over Husk of the Opulent Dreams stacks due to their conflicting nature in gaining stacks (Off-field and on-field).

[Skyward Pride](#weapon:skyward-pride)<br>
Can be a great or bad weapon for Itto depending on your ER needs. The less Energy Recharge you need (due to particle generation from your party members or ER from subs), the less useful this weapon becomes.

[Whiteblind](#weapon:whiteblind)<br>
Your rotations often start with 1 stack of this weapon, and due to Itto's Burst snapshotting DEF on cast, you're unable to take advantage of further DEF% from the stacks.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Retracting Bolide (4)](#artifact:retracing-bolide)<br>
Bolide grants you an additional 40% Normal and Charged Attack DMG when shielded. Crystallize can be unreliable so a consistent shielder is preferred, such as Zhongli.


# === characters.#jean.roles.#burst_support.name ===

burst support


# === characters.#jean.roles.#burst_support.notes ===

Jean's Elemental Skill can be used to fling smaller mobs into the air to deal fall damage, and to stagger bigger ones. **Her healing scales with ATK.**

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Amenoma Kageuchi](#weapon:amenoma-kageuchi)<br>
This weapon can lower your ER% requirements from anywhere between **\~150% to no additional ER% needed,** depending on the **number of stacks on the passive and the refinement of this weapon.** As such, at **higher refines / more stacks on the passive,** this weapon can perform **better than [Skyward Blade,](#weapon:skyward-blade)** while at **lower refines / less stacks, it can perform worse.**

[Freedom-Sworn](#weapon:freedom-sworn)<br>
The ranking here only **assumes Jean's personal damage and not the utility it gives.** If you want to furthermore buff your main DPS, you can give this sword to Jean as she **can trigger Freedom-Sworn's skill relatively easily since Anemo is always trigger.**

[Lion's Roar](#weapon:lions-roar)<br>
Depending on passive uptime, it can be ranked over [Favonius Sword](#weapon:favonius-sword) (at 50% uptime) and even [Aquila Favonia](#weapon:aquila-favonia) (at 100% uptime).

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Viridescent Venerer (4)](#artifact:viridescent-venerer)<br>
The bread and butter for Anemo characters in general, as it is commonly used for the 40% elemental resistance shred.

[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)<br>
Another option for providing utilities to the team. This set gives a 20% partywide ATK boost after Jean casts her Elemental Burst.

[Ocean-Hued Clam (4)](#artifact:ocean-hued-clam)<br>
The best set for Jean's personal damage, as the damage it deals scales with Jean's burst healing. However, because Jean's total damage output is on the low end, it is generally recommended to prioritize utility options such as Noblesse Oblige or Viridescent Venerer over this set.

**Regarding Main Stats Priority**

Elemental Mastery should only be used **when Jean is paired with Bennett,** as her burst ticks will swirl the self applied Pyro from Bennett's burst, acting as a damage source and Pyro application. Because of this, high burst uptime is required and so weapons with EM and ER passives are preferred. ([Freedom Sworn](#weapon:freedom-sworn), [Skyward Blade](#weapon:skyward-blade), [Favonius Sword](#weapon:favonius-sword), [Sacrificial Sword](#weapon:sacrificial-sword), [Iron Sting](#weapon:iron-sting), [Amenoma Kageuchi](#weapon:amenoma-kageuchi))

**Regarding Talent Priorities**

If you prefer more damage than healing, prioritize Elemental Skill over Elemental Burst since it scales better.

For Support Jean, you can either go for more ATK for stronger heals, but relatively lower Burst uptime, or more ER for lower heals, but higher Burst uptime.

Choosing between these two is up to personal preference, although if another Anemo character is on the team, Jean has very little energy problem and can potentially go full Sub DPS build.

# === characters.#kaeya.roles.#freeze.name ===

freeze


# === characters.#kaeya.roles.#freeze.subStats.notes ===

Generally has less value than the other offensive stats due to [Blizzard Strayer](#artifact:blizzard-strayer) and Cryo Resonance


# === characters.#kaeya.roles.#freeze.talents.notes ===

If not paired with Chongyun, Skill takes priority over Normal Attacks


# === characters.#kaeya.roles.#freeze.tips ===

**\[C1\]** against Cryo affected enemies


# === characters.#kaeya.roles.#freeze.notes ===

Kaeya freeze is mostly used in a team with Chongyun and Xingqiu/Barbara while having Blizzard Strayer (4) equipped. In this team, Kaeya has 55% crit rate against Frozen enemies without any additional Crit stats, which means Crit Rate substats are generally prioritized less than ATK% or Crit DMG.

**Melt**
Kaeya's Elemental Burst makes him an excellent source of Cryo application for characters that often stay in melee range, although his burst can't be fully utilized with Reverse Melt teams due to how his Cryo damage is split into a barrage of attacks.

Kaeya's Elemental Burst makes him an excellent source of Cryo application for characters that often stay in melee range, although his burst can't be fully utilized with Reverse Melt teams due to how his Cryo damage is split into a barrage of attacks.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Skyward Blade](#weapon:skyward-blade)<br>
In teams with a **2nd Cryo unit generating energy,** this weapon would have a lower priority as the Energy Recharge stat would mostly be wasted.

[Lion's Roar ](#weapon:lions-roar)**/**[ The Alley Flash](#weapon:the-alley-flash) / [Iron Sting](#weapon:iron-sting)At **\[R5\],** these weapons would **outperform Summit Shaper.**

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Instructor (4)](#artifact:instructor)<br>
Due to his ability to easily trigger Instructor's passive, Kaeya is a good holder of **Instructor (4)** for Reverse Melt teams. Aside from ER%, most of his other main stats don't matter as much, making this one of his budget support builds.

[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)<br>
This set is only recommended if there is no other member of the team running Noblesse Oblige (4).

# === characters.#kazuha.roles.#em_build.name ===

em build

# === characters.#kazuha.roles.#em_build.subStats.notes ===

Prioritize Energy Recharge if his Energy Requirements are not met yet.


# === characters.#kazuha.roles.#em_build.talents.notes ===

For an EM-focused build, upgrading Kazuha's talent levels isn't a necessity.

Note that upgrading Kazuha's NA talent increases the damage of his plunge attacks.

# === characters.#kazuha.roles.#em_build.tips ===

The element which is absorbed by Kazuha's elemental burst follows the priority of Pyro > Hydro > Electro > Cryo, and can be absorbed from both the active character and enemies. (i.e. Standing in Bennett 's Elemental Burst will result in Kazuha's Elemental Burst infusing Pyro as Bennett's Elemental Burst applies Pyro to the active character)

**Recommended ER Thresholds**

With Raiden: \~160 ER%
General Teams: \~180 ER%
Melt Ganyu: \~200 ER%


# === characters.#kazuha.roles.#em_build.notes ===

Kazuha's 4th Ascension Passive encourages players to maximise Elemental Mastery in order to maximise his utility.

Similar to Venti, due to the EM buffs, a triple EM build will out-damage a regular ATK-EM/Anemo/Crit build as long as there are 2+ enemies due to the amount of swirls involved. Because of this, an ADC (Attack/Damage/Crit) build isn't recommended unless he is in a team whereby he cannot make use of his A4 passive or swirls. (i.e. mono Anemo/Geo teams)

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

The ultimate goal is to try stack as much EM while getting enough ER for a consistent Burst uptime. Having Sacrificial Sword or a second Anemo character in the team will also help reduce the needs for ER and prioritize EM substats more.

**[Favonius Sword](#weapon:favonius-sword)**<br>
With this weapon, try to aim for some Crit Rate stats to trigger the weapon passive reliably.

**[Xiphos' Moonlight](#weapon:xiphos-moonlight)** 
In teams where you can meet energy requirements without needing the extra particles from Favonius Sword this is a better choice with stronger personal damage and buffing. Also at high refinements (R4-R5) it starts beating Favonius Sword in team energy generation too.<br>

**[Iron Sting](#weapon:iron-sting)**
Iron Sting will yield the highest upfront EM and teamwide buff if compared to the other 4 star options, if you manage to meet his energy needs or simply don't need more than one rotation, this would be the better option if compared to the Energy Recharge weapons.

**[Toukabou Shigure](#weapon:toukabou-shigure)**
This weapon performs very similarly to Iron Sting in a Swirl focused build even at higher refinements since its passive does not effect Swirl damage.

**[Amenoma Kageuchi](#weapon:amenoma-kageuchi)**
At R5, Amenoma Kageuchi needs no extra ER, and can focus building entirely EM. This makes it roughly equal to Iron Sting. At R1, Amenoma Kageuchi needs 138% Energy Recharge to burst consistently.<br>

**[Sapwood Blade](#weapon:sapwood-blade)**
Only really viable at high refinement in specific dendro teams where you can trigger dendro reactions usually through swirling Electro/Hydro on enemies with dendro applied to them (most consistently done in aggravate reaction comps).


**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Thundering Fury (4)](#artifact:thundering-fury)<br>
This is a niche build that excels only in AOE situations and with specific teams. Those teams include an off-field Hydro and Electro support to allow Kazuha to constantly trigger the 4p effect and spam his Elemental Skill, aswell as another Anemo support to hold the Viridiscent Venerer (4) set. Such teams can be Kazuha + Kokomi + Fischl + Venti, with Barbara and Sucrose being weaker replacements for Kokomi and Venti. This team triggers multiple fall damage instances against enemies that can be Crowd Controlled by Kazuha. Fischl can use The Viridiscent Hunt bow to allow for more fall damage instances. \*\*NOTE: This team performs very poorly in pure single target situations

physical dps


# === characters.#keqing.roles.#physical_dps.talents.notes ===

Refer to Notes below


# === characters.#keqing.roles.#physical_dps.notes ===

This section is dedicated to a playstyle where Keqing does not infuse her attacks with electro, and instead focuses on physical damage (white numbers). For this reason, you should be charged attacking after casting Stellar Restoration (E) instead of recasting it.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Pale Flame (4)](#artifact:pale-flame)**<br>
This set is the best by far as Keqing can proc its 4 piece set bonus instantly by charge attacking after casting E.

**[+25% Physical DMG set ](#25%-ph-atk)+ [Bloodstained Chivalry (2)](#artifact:bloodstained-chivalry)**<br>
This set should only be used until getting Pale Flame (4).

**[+25% Physical DMG set ](#25%-ph-atk)+ [18% ATK set (2)](#artifact:18%-atk)**<br>
The generalist Physical DPS set.

**[Retracing Bolide (4)](#artifact:retracing-bolide)**<br>
This set should only be used with a consistent shielder (i.e. Zhongli/Diona) for obvious reasons.

**[Bloodstained Chivalry (4)](#artifact:bloodstained-chivalry)**<br>
This set is for general solo and Abyss content where there are multiple mobs that can be killed with charged attacks within 10 seconds, this is for dealing with a crowd, in other words, AoE. It is not recommended because of the kill condition.


# === characters.#keqing.roles.#electro_dps.name ===

electro dps

# === characters.#keqing.roles.#electro_dps.tips ===

**Preferred Skill Combo: **Skill (Place stiletto, don't reactivate yet) -> Burst -> Skill (Reactivation) -> Spam NA Combo (See Below) -> Repeat

**NA Combos:<br>
N1C = 1 Normal Attack followed by a Charged Attack - Highest DPS Combo, but costs a lot of stamina<br>
N4C = 4 Normal Attacks followed by a Charged Attack - Second best Combo, and conserves stamina.


# === characters.#keqing.roles.#electro_dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Lion's Roar](#weapon:lions-roar)**
This weapon is only recommended on Pure Electro / Electro-charged teams. In teams where the Electro Aura can be easily removed OR when facing enemies with innate elements, this weapon will severely underperform.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Thundering Fury (2)](#artifact:thundering-fury) [+18% ATK set (2)](#artifact:18%-atk)**
This set is a generalist set, which means it can be used generally anywhere, whether it be Co-op or Abyss, or other singleplayer content. This has a lot of consistency due to its independence from electro aura, and it is more viable in abyss.<br>

**[+18% ATK set (2)](#artifact:18%-atk) + [+18% ATK set (2)](#artifact:18%-atk)**
While it is slightly behind Thundering Fury (2) +18% ATK set (2), this set is preferred to farm for due to the resin efficiency of Shimenawa's Reminiscence's Domain.

**[Thundersoother (4)](#artifact:thundersoother)**
This set should be used with Electro-charged team compositions (Keqing + Xingqiu). This set has a 35% DMG modifier which increases all damage from all sources, although that modifier is a bit unstable due to its dependency to the sustainability of Electro aura on enemies.


# === characters.#keqing.roles.#aggravate_dps.name ===

It is recommended to level Keqing to level 90


# === characters.#keqing.roles.#aggravate_dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Harbinger of Dawn](#weapon:harbinger-of-dawn) \[R5\]**
This ranking assumes full uptime on the passive. If you cannnot maintain the passive, this weapon is not recommended.

**[Summit Shaper](#weapon:summit-shaper)**
This ranking assumes Keqing is unshielded. If Keqing has a shielder, this weapon will perform better than Harbinger of Dawn \[R5\].

**[Toukabou Shigure](#weapon:toukabou-shigure)**
Eventually with high refinement [Lion's Roar](#weapon:lions-roar) or [The Black Sword](#weapon:the-black-sword) will surpass it. But this ranking assumes \[R1\] for both, [Iron Sting](#weapon:iron-sting) can also surpass it at equal refinement in Multi-target content where Toukabou Shigure's passive falls off, since it can only be applied to one target at a time.

**Regarding Artifact Choices**

**[Gilded Dreams (4)](#artifact:gilded-dreams)**
This set encourages the use of ATK% Sands over an EM Sands.


# === characters.#klee.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/klee/) from Klee Mains + KQM


# === characters.#klee.roles.#dps.name ===

dps


# === characters.#klee.roles.#dps.tips ===

Klee has access to a number of animation cancels that allow her to deal damage with her talents faster than normal.

Her N1 can be canceled through holding a directional key while clicking attack. This can be chained over and over again to produce a "machine gun" effect.

Her optimal combos include N1C and N2C. N1C is higher DPS but eats stamina faster, while N2C has more consistency in keeping enemies stunned and gives a higher chance of obtaining her A1 passive onto the following CA.

# === characters.#klee.roles.#dps.notes ===

Being extremely squishy and prone to interruptions, Klee requires great positioning. Check out the in-depth guide to learn in-depth about animation cancelling which may help with this issue.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Memory of Dust](#weapon:memory-of-dust)<br>
This weapon's rankings assume that Klee is played without a shielder, as forcing a shielder for the additional 20 ATK% leads to a damage loss compared to her best teams, even if said shielder is Zhongli. If in a situation where Klee is played with a shielder anyway, this weapon would be on par with [Skyward Atlas](#weapon:skyward-atlas)

[Solar Pearl](#weapon:solar-pearl)<br>
When using Solar Pearl, it is recommended to animation cancel a Normal Attack into an Elemental Skill and cancel that into her Elemental Burst at the start of her field time.

[Dodoco Tales](#weapon:dodoco-tales)<br>
On equal refinements, Widsith and Solar Pearl are better than Dodoco Tales, but when assuming \[R5\] Dodoco Tales vs \[R1\]-\[R3\] Widsith/Pearl, Dodoco Tales is better. Note that Bennett buff / Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer's buff + Noblesse Oblige (4) buff may push Widsith and Solar Pearl above Dodoco Tales, even at low refinements.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Lavawalker (4)](#artifact:lavawalker)<br>
Klee's kit makes it harder to utilize Vaporize and Melt the same way another pyro carry would, but her constant pyro application makes Lavawalkers a viable set. See KleefulFrame's great [number breakdown here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JJZPMoNOqXhX8Ez1cl63fNXESJZXx7kQaJEeQ-WLOEY/edit#gid=186983353)

[Crimson Witch of Flames (4)](#artifact:crimson-witch-of-flames)<br>
This set is only recommended in a team where Klee is able to trigger Vaporize consistently

[Wanderer's Troupe (4)](#artifact:wanderers-troupe)<br>
Wanderer's Troupe increases the Charged Attack by another 35% Damage Bonus. It can serve as a decent DPS choice but due to how clunky Klee's attack animations are, it's hard to put this in actual practiсe as it requires you to dodge more and consume more stamina, not to mention how the DPS gets caught up by the other builds mentioned above.


# === characters.#kokomi.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/kokomi/) from Kokomi Mains + KQM


# === characters.#kokomi.roles.#support.name ===

support


# === characters.#kokomi.roles.#support.mainStats.notes ===

Mainstats are not important for [Tenacity of the Milelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith) if you do not need the extra healing. Focus on Energy Recharge substats instead.


# === characters.#kokomi.roles.#support.tips ===

Kokomi's Elemental Burst dynamically alters her skill's damage, this means that you cannot use her Burst to snapshot the buff onto the Skill and swap out.<br>


# === characters.#kokomi.roles.#support.notes ===

Support Kokomi focuses on just using her Elemental Burst before her Elemental Skill's duration ends to refresh her skill duration. This allows 100% uptime on Hydro application from her Elemental Skill for Freeze / Electro-charge teams.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Hakushin Ring](#weapon:hakushin-ring)<br>
This weapon can provide Elemental DMG% for the team in **Electro-charged teams** and will outperform Prototype Amber if you value damage more than healing.

[Sacrificial Fragments](#weapon:sacrificial-fragments)<br>
Can be useful as Kokomi won't need to use her Elemental Burst to reset her skill duration. This **allows for smoother rotations** as she will not face the problem of missing out on the reset for her Elemental Skill due to not casting Burst in time.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)<br>
With proper extension of Kokomi's Elemental Skill, she can maintain near **100% uptime on this artifact set's 4 piece effect.**

[Ocean Hued Clam (4)](#artifact:ocean-hued-clam)<br>
This ranking assumes Kokomi is being used **only for her Elemental Skill.** If she is being used to attack onfield during Elemental Burst, this set may **overtake Tenacity of the Millelith (4).**

**Regarding Main Stats and Sub Stats**

**Energy Recharge**<br>
Prioritise Energy Recharge first to ensure you can always use Elemental Burst before the Elemental Skill expires in order to maintain Hydro application. Without Prototype Amber, Kokomi will need \~200-220%+ Energy Recharge (170-190% with Prototype Amber at \[R1\] and 150-170% at \[R5\])


# === characters.#kokomi.roles.#dps.name ===

dps

# === characters.#kokomi.roles.#dps.subStats.advices.2.notes ===

≈ Flat HP


# === characters.#kokomi.roles.#dps.tips ===

Due to Kokomi's high stamina cost on her Charged Attacks, her best attack strings are:

At **\[C0\]:** N2D<br>
At **\[C1\]:** N3D

\*NA = Normal Attack, D = Dash

N3D might result in a loss of Beidou Stormbreaker hits (DPS loss), and as such is only recommended in a Vaporize comp where the added Hydro application is favoured.


# === characters.#kokomi.roles.#dps.notes ===

DPS Kokomi aims to maximise her onfield damage during her Elemental Burst's duration. Outside of her Elemental Burst, her damage is lackluster and not worth building for.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers](#weapon:thrilling-tales-of-dragon-slayers)**<br>
Although this weapon doesn't provide as much personal damage for Kokomi, the 48% ATK buff is usually more worth in most cases. This can be her best weapon in for overall team DPS if you don't already have another Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers user in your team.

**[Hakushin Ring](#weapon:hakushin-ring)**<br>
This weapon can provide Elemental DMG% for the team in Electro-charged teams, and is the best choice in those situations.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
Although this set offers the lowest personal dmg for Kokomi, the 20% ATK team buff can sometimes be better for overall team DPS.


# === characters.#kokomi.roles.#bloom_dps.name ===

bloom dps


# === characters.#kokomi.roles.#bloom_dps.notes ===

This build is specifically for Bloom teams where Kokomi is the character intended to trigger the majority of blooms.

**Regarding Aritfact Sets**

**[Ocean-Hued Clam (4)](#artifact:ocean-hued-clam)**
This set can do more damage than other options in certain situations, while also increasing Kokomi's healing to deal with Bloom self-damage. However, this set is very resin inefficient and is thus not recommended to farm specifically for this set.

# === characters.#kujou-sara.roles.#burst_support.name ===

burst support


# === characters.#kujou-sara.roles.#burst_support.subStats.notes ===

Prioritize Energy Recharge first until you can burst off cooldown


# === characters.#kujou-sara.roles.#burst_support.tips ===

For her Elemental Skill to generate particles, you need to perform a Charged Shot to place a Crowfeather after casting her Elemental Skill. If the Crowfeather explosion hits an enemy, it generates 3 particles.

Crowfeathers generated from Sara's \[C2\] do NOT generate particles.


# === characters.#kujou-sara.roles.#burst_support.notes ===

Sara is a quickswap support who is able to buff your active characters via its Crowfeather mechanics. When Sara uses her Elemental Skill, her next Charged Shot will leave a Crowfeather on the target location and after a short while, the Crowfeather explodes and **the active character in its AoE will benefit from Sara's ATK buff, which scales with her Base ATK.**

At \[C2\], you can skip the Charged Shot as it immediately drops a Crowfeather, and save it for later on if you wanna swap back to her to extend her buffs. You can also use Elemental Skill followed by Elemental Burst so that she benefits from the Crowfeather dropped by her Elemental Skill, then swap to other character so that character can benefit from Sara's ATK buff. It's worth mentioning that Sara's Crit DMG buff at \[C6\] doesn't snapshot and it also doesn't show on the stats page, so don't freak out when you don't see it there.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

Weapons here are **ranked based on their Base ATK** to maximize Sara's ATK buff.

**[Elegy for the End](#weapon:elegy-for-the-end)**<br>
The cooldown on this weapon's passive aligns perfectly with Sara's Elemental Burst cooldown. This weapon has lower base ATK if compared with Skyward Harp, but this weapon can be considered over Skyward Harp since Sara is able to trigger the weapon passive quite easily with her Elemental Burst to provide your party members with another 100 EM and 20% ATK buff for 12 seconds, it also has Energy Recharge substat which is very valuable on a Burst Support Sara.

**[Sacrificial Bow](#weapon:sacrificial-bow)** 
The combination of high base atk and a energy recharge substat makes this one of her best four star weapon options in teams where she needs a energy recharge weapon to meet energy requirements and battery another electro unit at the same time.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**<br>
Universal support set that is able to buff your party member's ATK by 20%, use this set on Sara if there's nobody else in the party who's equipping one.

# === characters.#kuki-shinobu.roles.#hyperbloom.subStats.notes ===

Elemental Mastery is essentially your only priority


# === characters.#kuki-shinobu.roles.#hyperbloom.tips ===

Aim for around 850-950+ Elemental Mastery. Depending on whether you use a Elemental Mastery weapon or not.


# === characters.#kuki-shinobu.roles.#hyperbloom.notes ===

This is a dendro team that requires a reliable electro trigger unit to work, for which Kuki is one of the best electro units to perform this role.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Key of Khaj-Nisut](#weapon:key-of-khaj-nisut)**
This becomes a better choice than Iron Sting at \[C4\] when you can gain the 3rd passive stack without extending your rotation time or taking extra field time. It can also net more Elemental Mastery than Freedom-Sworn at 3 stacks, assuming you have actually built some HP% Substats on your Sands/Goblet/Circlet, but this is usually not enough to out-perform the overall gains from Xiphos' Moonlight/Freedom-sworn's respective passives.<br>

**[Toukabou Shigure](#weapon:toukabou-shigure)**
This weapon performs very similarly in a hyperbloom focused build to Iron sting since its passive does not effect Hyperbloom damage.

[Noblesse Oblige (2)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige) \[Choose Two\]


# === characters.#kuki-shinobu.roles.#aggravate.notes ===

This adds flat damage to the triggering electro attack that scales of elemental mastery and levels, which essentially allows Kuki's personal damage to become relevant while also filling the role of a healer in the team.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**<br>

For more details see the sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x5UJIlR8Kx1IC_8a_SRTaLjR_mzi0j1o2Ive0MpLfQU/edit#gid=401786943)<br>

**[Freedom Sworn](#weapon:freedom-sworn)**
While not having the highest personal damage it makes up for it in overall team damage through its competitive buffs.

**[Primordial Jade Cutter](#weapon:primordial-jade-cutter)**
Has the highest personal damage of any weapon on Kuki but little to no utility, which means it usually falls behind in overall team damage.

**[Key of Khaj-Nisut](#weapon:key-of-khaj-nisut)**
On paper combines a mixture of high personal damage with team buffs to potentially be her best weapon if you manage to get it fully stacked. This is usually a unrealistic scenario though with it taking up to 2-3 rotations to fully stack or forcing you to stay on-field to let it stack which is usually a net dps loss.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**<br>

For more details see the sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jMsRsXtgZU-C2TGj72eIB89THuinMafk6iSj63a7Vt8/edit#gid=2143201754)<br>

**[Thundersoother (4)](#artifact:thundersoother)**
It's potentially your BIS set if you can maintain constant electro aura or near that, to be this consistent usually takes up to 3 electro units (or possibly 2 electro units and a anemo unit like Kazuha or Venti swirling electro)

**[Thundering Fury (2)](#artifact:thundering-fury) [80 EM set (2)](#artifact:80-em) [18% ATK set (2)](#artifact:18%-atk)**
Usually performs so close to [Gilded Dreams (4)](#artifact:gilded-dreams) that you can simply pick the set or combination of sets with the highest possible substats.

# === characters.#kuki-shinobu.roles.#support.subStats.notes ===

Crit Rate is useful only when using Favonius Sword


# === characters.#kuki-shinobu.roles.#support.notes ===

Outside of reaction teams where she can be a reliable trigger unit, Kuki's damage contribution is usually insignificant. Hence her best usage case in those scenarios is building purely for utility.


**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Favonius Sword](#weapon:favonius-sword)**<br>
The passive lets her provide energy to the rest of the team. A crit rate circlet or substats should be considered to reliably trigger the passive.

**[Freedom-Sworn](#weapon:freedom-sworn)**<br>
In teams where Kuki can reliably trigger reactions, the teamwide buff from this weapon can make it preferable over Favonius Sword.

**[Key of Khaj-Nisut](#weapon:key-of-khaj-nisut)**
Highest possible healing in exchange for weaker utility. Worth considering in teams that can't reliably trigger reactions for Freedom-Sworn or don't need extra energy particles from Favonius Sword.


**Regarding Artifact Sets**<br>

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**<br>
When using this set, make sure to build enough Energy Recharge to cast Burst off cooldown and keep good uptime on Noblesse passive.

**[Ocean-Hued Clam (4)](#artifact:ocean-hued-clam)**<br>
Provides a decent amount of extra damage on a full healing build.

**[Instructors (4)](#artifact:instructor) or [The Exile (4)](#artifact:the-exile)**<br>
Can be a cheap alternative on teams where the extra ATK% buff from [Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith) or [Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige) is not as useful.

# === characters.#layla.roles.#support.notes ===

The goal of this build is to prioritize Layla's shield, and increase her damage where possible.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Freedom-Sworn](#weapon:freedom-sworn)**
This weapon can be a good option in teams where Layla can consistently trigger reactions.

**Regarding Artifact Choices**

**[Blizzard Strayer (4)](#artifact:blizzard-strayer) and [Emblem of Severed Fate (4)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate)**
These sets are primarily for increasing Layla's personal damage.

(N2CA when ES is on cooldown)

\*N/NA = Normal attack, C = Charged attack, ES = Elemental Skill


# === characters.#lisa.roles.#aggravate_dps.notes ===

This build makes the best use of Lisa's entire kit, from her EM ascension stat to her high rate of electro application. While also minimizing her high energy needs by making her an on-field driver for quicken teams, and is therefore her best usage case.

**Regarding Weapons:**<br>

For more details see the sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kBaIxbNUUkShl-OwbOxMK4wyPQvL-WWeOko7yfWRIxw/edit#gid=601082040)<br>

**The Widsith** 
At high refinement \[R4-R5\] this weapon starts performing similarly to Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds.<br>

**Solar Pearl**
At high refinement \[R4-R5\] this is competitive or even slightly better than Skyward Atlas, especially with external attack buffs.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**<br>

**Thundersoother (4)**
This set can outperform Gilded Dreams (4) in teams where she can keep high uptime on her electro application.


# === characters.#lisa.roles.#off-field_dps.name ===

off-field dps

# === characters.#lisa.roles.#off-field_dps.mainStats.notes ===

Only used in Quicken teams


# === characters.#lisa.roles.#off-field_dps.tips ===

Lisa's Hold cast does not require 4 full seconds of charging to reach maximum damage threshold, as long as the indicator aligns with ring, you can release your cast at max damage.


# === characters.#lisa.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

This build focuses more on making Lisa a flexible buffing/bursting unit in short durations as a part of a variety of teams including quickswap comps and, especially, Quicken comps.

**Regarding Weapon Choice**<br>

**Kagura's Verity**
This weapon's ranking is based on executing a specific rotation, but the rotation is different for Off-Field DPS. The rotation is Tap E > N2 > Tap E > Q > Hold E (3 Stack).<br>

**Thrilling Tales Of Dragon Slayers**
This option is only recommended on a low investment Lisa whereby she is focused around buffing her teammates and contributing team DPS over outputting high damage on her own.

**Regarding Stats Priority**
These options prioritize Lisa's Elemental Burst uptime as a defense shredding tool.


# === characters.#lisa.roles.#em_dps.name ===

em dps


# === characters.#lisa.roles.#em_dps.talents.notes ===

EM DPS Lisa's Talent Levels are not a necessity


# === characters.#lisa.roles.#em_dps.notes ===

This build aims to be the consistent trigger for reactions, Hyperbloom and Overload are generally the best reactions for this set up. These reactions are primarily triggered by her burst, which is why it's important to make sure its uptime is as high as possible. Avoid having a second Electro in the Overload team for this build since this could mess up the Pyro aura Lisa wants for this playstyle.

**Regarding Weapons**<br>

**Fruit of Fulfillment**
At high refinement this weapon performs similarly to A Thousand Floating Dreams while also having a significant amount of Energy Recharge on it making it easier to build around.

**Regarding Artifact sets**<br>

**Flower of Paradise Lost (4)**
This set only performs around 4-6% (varies according to the elemental composition of your team) better in terms of Hyperbloom damage. Therefore it's worth considering farming Gilded Dreams (4) instead since it's in a more resin efficient domain alongside Deepwood Memories (4).

**Regarding Stats Priority**
Try to invest both into EM and ER. The goal is to try stack as much EM while getting enough ER for a comfortable Burst uptime depending on your teams.


# === characters.#mona.roles.#dps.name ===

# === characters.#mona.roles.#dps.tips ===

<br>


# === characters.#mona.roles.#dps.notes ===

This build is best utilised at **\[C2\],** but can work without it. Do note that several 4 stars will out-dps Mona, as Mona is better off as a Sub-DPS or Support.


# === characters.#mona.roles.#nuke.name ===

nuke


# === characters.#mona.roles.#nuke.tips ===

To make Mona's burst damage trigger the Vaporize 2.0x multiplier:<br>
1. Apply Pyro on enemy<br>
2. Cast Burst (should react and remove Pyro status on the enemy after using Burst)<br>
3. Wait 2.5 seconds for Mona's burst ICD (Mona should stay on field if you have Bennett, to keep the buff)<br>
4. Swap to Pyro character and apply Pyro on enemy<br>
5. Burst will pop after enemy gets hit, applying Hydro and vaporising her damage.


# === characters.#mona.roles.#nuke.notes ===

Mona's **Elemental Skill provides taunt** and procs wet status on enemies, her **Elemental Burst is also capable of rendering smaller enemies immobile** (Mona needs to be at least 20 levels within the enemy's level) and **providing a huge damage burst** (and additional omen debuff after proc).

**Look to the Nuke Mona's Ability Tip section for Vaporize Nuke set up instructions.**


# === characters.#mona.roles.#freeze_support.name ===

Offensive stats aren't actually needed on a Freeze Support Mona, focus on Artifact Set Bonus


# === characters.#mona.roles.#freeze_support.subStats.notes ===

Offensive stats aren't needed, just stack ER for comfortable Elemental Burst uptime


# === characters.#mona.roles.#freeze_support.tips ===

Mona's Burst applies bubble and Omen debuff upon cast, the count down timer only begins when the bubble is broken.

Frozen enemies can have their bubbles preserved as long as enemies stay in a frozen state. This technique makes Mona a priority Support for Freeze DPS teams.


# === characters.#mona.roles.#freeze_support.notes ===

Mona's main role on a freeze team is to **provide Omen debuff** from her burst as **it is extendable via Freeze mechanics.** Note that you must **apply Cryo before casting Mona's Elemental Burst** for the extension to happen. Omen Freeze extension can be done by **reapplying Cryo and Hydro aura consistently** (this can be done with Cryo/ Hydro infused Venti Elemental Burst + on-field Cryo/ Hydro aura).

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers](#weapon:thrilling-tales-of-dragon-slayers)<br>
Generally the best option on Freeze Support Mona because she can furthermore buff the ATK of your Main DPS. This however comes with an assumption that with TTDS, you still have 100% Elemental Burst uptime. If you do not, pick the other Energy Recharge weapon options for more Elemental Burst uptime.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**<br>

**[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
Run this set if there's already another character with [Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige) on the team.

dps


# === characters.#ningguang.roles.#dps.artifacts.notes ===

≈ Lavawalker (4)\*


# === characters.#ningguang.roles.#dps.tips ===

Ningguang's Elemental Skill has a 6 second internal cooldown on generating energy, so for the sake of maintaining Elemental Burst uptime, wait 6 seconds to cast again if you need energy. It also breaks when casted on top of another Geo Structure, you can intentionally use a structure to break your first screen.


# === characters.#ningguang.roles.#dps.notes ===

Due to Ningguang having a really low Base ATK and no ATK conversion mechanics, external ATK buffers such as Bennett is recommended as a support for Ningguang to bump up her ATK stat.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Skyward Atlas](#weapon:skyward-atlas)**
Without Bennett, this weapon performs better than [Lost Prayers to the Sacred Winds](#weapon:lost-prayer-to-the-sacred-winds).

**[Memory of Dust](#weapon:memory-of-dust)**
Without Bennett, this weapon performs better than [Lost Prayers to the Sacred Winds](#weapon:lost-prayer-to-the-sacred-winds) and [Skyward Atlas](#weapon:skyward-atlas).

**[The Widsith](#weapon:the-widsith)**
At \[R5\] this weapon performs better than [Kagura's Verity](#weapon:kaguras-verity) on average.

**[Solar Pearl](#weapon:solar-pearl)**
At \[R5\] this weapon performs better than [The Widsith](#weapon:the-widsith) \[R5\] and [Kagura's Verity](#weapon:kaguras-verity). It is recommended to add a Normal Attack before casing Ningguang's other abilities.

**[Hakushin Ring](#weapon:hakushin-ring)**
This weapon performs better than [Mappa Mare](#weapon:mappa-mare) when an electro character is in the party.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Emblem of Severed Fate (2)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate)**
This set performs worse than other options when Ningguang does not need to build Energy Recharge%.

**[Thundersoother (4)](#artifact:thundersoother)**
This set performs better than [Archaic Petra (2)](#artifact:archaic-petra) [Emblem of Severed Fate (2)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate) if an electro aura is always present on the enemy.<br>

**[Lavawalker (4)](#artifact:lavawalker)**
This set performs better than [Archaic Petra (2)](#artifact:archaic-petra) [Emblem of Severed Fate (2)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate) if a pyro aura is always present on the enemy.<br>

**[Archaic Petra (4)](#artifact:archaic-petra)**
This set tends to be the best set for overall team damage in many cases. However, Archaic Petra is extremely resin-inefficient to farm and is therefore only recommended to be farmed over time from the artifact strongbox.

**[Emblem of Severed Fate (4)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate)**
This set will perform better than [Archaic Petra (2)](#artifact:archaic-petra) [18% ATK set (2)](#artifact:18%-atk) if you need the Energy Recharge and you do not use Charge Attacks more than normal.

**[Husk of Opulent Dreams (4)](#artifact:husk-of-opulent-dreams)**
This set performs on par with [Archaic Petra (2)](#artifact:archaic-petra) [18% ATK set (2)](#artifact:18%-atk) so is only recommended if you already own a good set.

\[C6\] is assumed for this ranking.

ATK% sands when below C6 and below Talent Level 9 Burst.


# === characters.#noelle.roles.#dps.subStats.advices.1.notes ===

\~20-30%


# === characters.#noelle.roles.#dps.tips ===

Optimal attack rotation is **N1>N2>N3>N4>dash/hop,** where N refers to each normal attack in her 4 hit combo. This isn't always feasible due to cast time and N4 covers a lesser AoE than N1-3 (as well as knockback issues), so the recommended rotation is **N1>N2>N3>dash/hop.**


# === characters.#noelle.roles.#dps.notes ===

**It's recommended to avoid building a DPS Noelle if she's not \[C5+\].**<br>
Noelle DPS is best optimized at **\[C6\]** where she converts an additional 50% DEF into ATK. Her ability to sustain her team with shields, heals and AOE damage makes for a reliable DPS when your team is built around her.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Serpent Spine](#weapon:serpent-spine)<br>
When using Husk of Opulent Dreams, Serpent Spine stacks are prioritized over Husk of the Opulent Dreams stacks due to their conflicting nature in gaining stacks (Off-field and on-field).

[Skyward Pride](#weapon:skyward-pride)<br>
Useful if you are unable to get ER from your substats. Does really well while its passive is active, but falls off in sustained fights. Comfort option that can lose to a high refined Whiteblind with stacks.

[Favonius Greatsword](#weapon:favonius-greatsword)<br>
Only recommended with high refines, as its usefulness scales with its particle generation capabilities. R5 allows her to self-battery assuming some additional particles from enemies, but a second Geo is always recommended regardless for resonance.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Husk of Opulent Dreams (4)](#artifact:husk-of-opulent-dreams)<br>
Noelle snapshots her DEF on burst cast. To get the full 4 stacks' DEF% boost during your first burst, you need to wait 12 seconds off field before swapping in. In abyss, time spent before the chamber starts still generates stacks.

[Retracing Bolide (4)](#artifact:retracing-bolide)<br>
Optimally offers slightly less damage than Gladiator's, but is much easier to farm per resin and can have 100% uptime with crystallise shields. Consider Gladiator's Finale if you don't want to farm for [Archaic Petra](#artifact:archaic-petra) as Artifact Strongbox is much more effective than elite bosses in terms of artifacts per resin.


# === characters.#noelle.roles.#support.name ===

support


# === characters.#noelle.roles.#support.artifacts.notes ===

Ideally just run with whatever DEF% main stats you have. Set bonuses are not important, focus on stacking DEF.


# === characters.#noelle.roles.#support.tips ===

Use her charged attacks for healing as they are much faster than normal attacks.


# === characters.#noelle.roles.#support.notes ===

Support Noelle is not currently recommended in any content due to her extremely lackluster healing and poor shield uptime.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Sacrificial Greatsword](#weapon:sacrificial-greatsword)<br>
Does not proc on Noelle's **\[C4\]** if she's off field, so a high refine is needed for the initial cast to reliably reset cooldown. Even with **\[R5\],** the cooldown is 16 seconds while Noelle's shield duration is 12, so forced downtime is an issue.

[Favonius Greatsword](#weapon:favonius-greatsword)<br>
Relies on hitting crits to generate energy. The 12 second cooldown at **\[R1\]** matches with her shield cooldown. Generally not recommended unless you have an abundance of crit substats or wish to build her pseudo-DPS.


# === characters.#qiqi.roles.#support.name ===

support


# === characters.#qiqi.roles.#support.notes ===

Qiqi's Burst has an 80 energy cost with her skill not generating any energy until **\[C1\].** Energy Recharge will greatly benefit Qiqi, while her Burst should be kept as a last resort.

Qiqi's Burst allows other characters to maximize DPS field time while offering healing from being off-field. At Ascension 4, her Normal Attack applies the healing talisman onto an enemy with a cooldown of 30 seconds.

**Regarding Weapon and Artifact Choices**

[Sacrificial Sword](#weapon:sacrificial-sword) and [Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)<br>
Tenacity of the Millelith allows Qiqi to give the team a **decent ATK boost** while staying in enemy melee reach with Skill active. Sacrificial Sword increases the uptime of her Skill, which in turn increases the uptime of the team's ATK boost. If you find that your Qiqi's heals are often more than enough, you may consider switching her to this artifact set. **Do note that other characters might utilize Sacrificial Sword more than Qiqi, such as Xingqiu, Kazuha, etc.**

[Ocean Hued Clam (4)](#artifact:ocean-hued-clam)<br>
This ranking assumes **Qiqi does not get her Elemental Burst up often** and is instead relying mainly on her Elemental Skill for healing. If she is in a team which **funds her enough energy particles,** or if she acts as the **on-field DPS,** this set can **overtake Tenacity of the Millelith (4).**

EM is essentially your only priority


# === characters.#raiden-shogun.roles.#hyperbloom.tips ===

You are aiming for between 850-1000+ Elemental mastery depending on weapon/artifact choice.


# === characters.#raiden-shogun.roles.#hyperbloom.notes ===

In this build Raiden is used as a Hyperbloom trigger unit in a dendro team. She is one of the best units in the game for this role. Bringing greater energy particle generation, a faster rate of seed triggering and a team ult buff in exchange for reduced team flexibility compared to another top hyperbloom triggering unit like Kuki.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**<br>

**+80 EM set (2) and +80 EM set (2)**
In a team with one other electro unit it's only 1 substat roll behind Gilded Dreams (4) (3-4 substat rolls behind in a team with no other electro units) therefore you can usually just use the set with the most Elemental Mastery substat rolls on it.<br>

[Thundering Fury (4)](#artifact:thundering-fury)
Only really a consideration if you have a completed set of it already, with a higher number of Elemental Mastery substat rolls, or as a placeholder set while you farm other sets.


# === characters.#raiden-shogun.roles.#dps.name ===

dps


# === characters.#raiden-shogun.roles.#dps.tips ===

Start your rotation with Raiden's Elemental Skill to amplify your party member's Elemental Burst damage.

**Burst combo**

Recommended: Skill > Burst > 3NA + CA (3 times) > 1NA + CA
Optimal: Skill > Burst > 3NA + CA (3 times) > 1NA + CA

NA = Normal Attack, CA = Charged Attack

The recommended combo can be performed consistently even without attack speed buffs, the optimal combo while a tad stronger is also significantly more difficult to perform.


# === characters.#raiden-shogun.roles.#dps.notes ===

Raiden's Elemental Burst damage depends on her team's energy consumption prior to her Burst,** and her Burst **restores a comfortable amount of energy for her team (which is further amplified by her passive). This is especially convenient on teams that doesn't conflict with her element and wants the energy provision. (IE Eula, Electro, National teams, etc.). Raiden has no issues with firing her ult off cooldown after reaching about 200% Energy Recharge, but it is possible to raise it higher for better energy restoration for her team.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

This list assumes that Raiden is not ran with an external buffer.

**[Wavebreaker's Fin](#weapon:wavebreakers-fin)**<br>
\[R5\] Wavebreaker's Fin is relatively equal Staff of Homa, depending on your total team burst cost.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
This set acts as a low investment support oriented set. Raiden is an excellent ToTM holder since her Elemental Skill has 100% uptime and procs very easily. Do note that if your Raiden is equipping this set, then she will sacrifice her personal damage.

**Regarding Main Stats Priority**

Raiden's main stat priority for Sands and Goblet entirely depends on the substats, whether she has external buffs, and which weapon she is running.

Razor's EB grants you an Electro Status when you basic attack while burst is in-effect, that means it can be used for status-cleansing (no particular effective element).  Can only be done on himself.<br>


# === characters.#razor.roles.#dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Wolf's Gravestone](#weapon:wolfs-gravestone)**<br>
Wolf's Gravestone (inactive) outperforms Skyward Pride in every scenario except crowd battles.

**[Redhorn Stonethresher](#weapon:redhorn-stonethresher)**<br>
Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you're getting, this weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in personal damage.

**[The Unforged](#weapon:the-unforged)**<br>
The playstyle with this weapon becomes a lot more comfortable without having to worry about snapshotting Wolf's Gravestone / Song of Broken Pines buffs for Sub DPSes, while also granting more Shield Bonus for better Shield uptime. A shielder is required for this, with Zhongli being the most ideal option.

**[Serpent Spine](#weapon:serpent-spine)**<br>
At **\[C6\]** and high refinement Serpent Spine, it is better to run an ATK% Goblet over Physical Damage% with Serpent Spine. This is due to the oversaturation of damage bonuses (ascension stat + Serpent Spine) in addition to the fact that Electro accounts for a significant portion of Razor's damage. An in-depth explanation [can be found here](https://tinyurl.com/razoratk). **It is also worth noting that an \[R5\] Serpent Spine with max stacks can outperform all 5✩ weapons at \[R1\].**

**[Skyward Pride](#weapon:skyward-pride)**<br>
Skyward Pride is viable with a Physical DMG goblet, as the damage dealt through its passive scales with Physical%.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Pale Flame (2) ](#artifact:pale-flame)+ [Bloodstained Chivalry (2)](#artifact:bloodstained-chivalry)**<br>
This set is better if your ATK% is covered by your substats, otherwise you would be better off running Gladiator's Finale (4). **This is only recommended to those who have no immediate access to a decent Pale Flame (4) set, otherwise you would be better off investing on Pale Flame pieces, regardless of weapon choice.**

# === characters.#rosaria.roles.#reverse_melt.name ===

reverse melt


# === characters.#rosaria.roles.#reverse_melt.notes ===

This build capitalizes on the fact Rosaria's skill and burst dont have an ICD, allowing her to melt all skill and burst procs. Which in combination with snapshotting buffs onto her burst makes it one of her highest personal damage builds.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**<br>

**For more details see the sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F8kvHkdRidPgQAFfxoX3iW6nr6WNIJI1F_5l3TJTkdE/edit#gid=144036677)

**[Vortex Vanquisher](#weapon:vortex-vanquisher)**
The ranking assumes you are unshielded, If you do use a shield it can surpass Calamity Queller.<br>

**[Dragon's Bane](#weapon:dragons-bane)**
At High refinement \[R4-R5\] this performs a tad better than [Primordial Jade Winged-Spear](#weapon:primordial-jade-winged-spear).<br>

**[Wavebreaker's Fin](#weapon:wavebreakers-fin)**
At High refinement \[R4-R5\] with a 260 energy cost team this performs just below Staff of Homa.

**Deathmatch**
This weapon can outperform all 4 star options and even Primordial Jade Winged-Spear when used with Gilded Dreams (4) in single target situations.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**<br>

**[Emblem of Severed Fate (4)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate)**
in teams where her energy requirements are higher (130%+) it can surpass Lavawalker (4).

**Gilded Dreams (4)**
In teams where her energy requirements are at 120% or Lower it performs slightly better than Emblem of Severed Fate (4).


# === characters.#rosaria.roles.#freeze.name ===

freeze


# === characters.#rosaria.roles.#freeze.tips ===

If Rosaria is being used with Chongyun to infuse her normal attacks with Cryo, her Normal Attack talent will have higher priority than Skill.


# === characters.#rosaria.roles.#freeze.notes ===

This build can be used on both a quickswap/sub-dps and perma-freeze dps Rosaria. If played as a perma-freeze dps, Rosaria has the same team comp as Freeze Kaeya. Check Kaeya's ability tips section for teamcomp setup.

**Regarding Substats**<br>

Rosaria does not need much Energy Recharge if paired with Kaeya. If paired with another Cryo unit such as Chongyun or Ayaka, she will need \~130-150% Energy Recharge<br>

Compared to Kaeya, Rosaria has even less desire for Crit Rate, as her Ascension 1 Talent includes an extra 12% Crit Rate once skill hits the back of an enemy.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**<br>

**[Wavebreaker's Fin](#weapon:wavebreakers-fin)**
At high refinement \[R5\], this weapon can perform similarly to Staff of Homa, and even outperform it with a high energy cost team (260).<br>

**[Deathmatch](#weapon:deathmatch)**
Rosaria gets a lot of Crit Rate from Blizzard Strayer (4) and Cryo Resonance. As a result, this weapon falls off in value as you will tend to overcap above 100% Crit rate. If Rosaria is being used without the Blizzard Strayer (4) set, then this weapon can perform better compared to other options.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**
This set is only used in her sub-dps/quickswap roles not her perma-freeze dps role. Also it should only be considered when you have no decent Blizzard Strayer (4) pieces and no one else on the team is holding Noblesse Oblige (4).


# === characters.#rosaria.roles.#support.name ===

support


# === characters.#rosaria.roles.#support.tips ===

Be sure to cast skill before burst as Crit Rate granted by the Ascension 1 Talent will be included with Ascension 4 Talent Bonus as well.

Rosaria's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst can be Reverse Melted (1.5x) with another Pyro applier for some quick and powerful damage.


# === characters.#rosaria.roles.#support.notes ===

This Build focuses on her Buffing/Energy generation/Cryo application capabilities. Though it does not mean that you dont invest in her personal damage, only that it's a lower priority overall.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**<br>

**[Favonius Lance](#weapon:favonius-lance)**
The best option in situations where you havent met your teams energy requirements. Outside of that scenario you would be better of using a Crit Rate weapon that benefits her A4 buff.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**<br>

**[Instructor (4)](#artifact:instructor)**
Can be the better option in teams that prefer the Elemental Mastery buff over ATK, such as Hu Tao VapeMelt.


# === characters.#sayu.roles.#support.name ===

support


# === characters.#sayu.roles.#support.tips ===

Use hold Skill then immediately press it to generate more particles.


# === characters.#sayu.roles.#support.notes ===

Sayu does more damage with EM builds and heals more with ATK hybrid builds, Healing Bonus hat can be used for better heals while maintaining respectable damage. Note that Sayu wants a large amount of energy recharge when used as the only anemo slot on the team (200%ish).

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Wolf's Gravestone](#weapon:wolfs-gravestone)<br>
Wolf's Gravestone is a universal claymore that is capable of buffing your teammates along with providing more healing in Sayu's case. It is best used once you achieve your ER threshold.

**[Forest Regalia](#weapon:forest-regalia)**
When used in its niche with aggravate teams it can outpeform [Katsuragikiri Nagamasa](#weapon:katsuragikiri-nagamasa). Outside of that its just a energy% stat stick.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Viridescent Venerer](#artifact:viridescent-venerer)<br>
The bread and butter artifact set for Anemo units, this set provides the ability to shred the enemy's elemental resistance while also buffing Sayu's swirl damage output.


# === characters.#shenhe.roles.#support.name ===

support


# === characters.#shenhe.roles.#support.notes ===

Shenhe is a Support for Cryo characters, capable of providing damage buffs from her Elemental Skill and dealing damage while providing Cryo and Physical resistance shred from her Elemental Burst. Her Elemental Skill gives a few stacks of additional flat damage bonus to all nearby party members (5 stacks on Tap and 7 stacks on Hold). This additional flat damage bonus only works on Cryo attacks, so characters who don't use Cryo attacks don't benefit from Shenhe's Elemental Skill, do note that Cryo infusion from Anemo characters does act as a Cryo attack, so it benefits from Shenhe's Elemental Skill. Another thing to note is that the additional flat damage bonus Shenhe provides uses Shenhe's current ATK, so it doesn't snapshot.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Calamity Queller](#weapon:calamity-queller)<br>
The passive of this weapon works perfectly with Shenhe's Elemental Skill because it's dynamic. This weapon also has high Base ATK which makes ATK% substats really effective.

[Engulfing Lightning](#weapon:engulfing-lightning)<br>
This weapon provides Energy Recharge and converts Energy Recharge to ATK, which benefits Shenhe a lot.

[Vortex Vanquisher](#weapon:vortex-vanquisher)<br>
This weapon's passive can't be stacked off-field, but it's still an ATK stat stick which provides Shenhe with a lot of ATK.

[Favonius Lance](#weapon:favonius-lance)<br>
With this weapon, it is better to have some Crit Rate on Shenhe for the weapon passive to proc. (Do note that Cryo Resonance provides 15% Crit Rate on Cryo-imbued enemies, so the need for Crit Rate on Shenhe is lowered)

**Regarding Main Stats Priority**

If you're equipping an ATK% weapon, try to aim for an Energy Recharge sands and vice versa.

# === characters.#heizou.roles.#anemo_dps.name ===

anemo dps


# === characters.#heizou.roles.#anemo_dps.notes ===

Shikanoin Heizou's Anemo DPS build is roughly equal to his EM build assuming he isn't being used in an electro-charged team. He has very low energy recharge needs, ranging from 110% to 130%. At constellation four he can run 100% energy recharge.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**<br>

**[Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds](#weapon:lost-prayer-to-the-sacred-winds)** 
In teams where Shikanoin Heizou and Bennett are used in the same team, this weapon is equal to Skyward Atlas.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**<br>
**[Viridescent Venerer (4)](#artifact:viridescent-venerer)**
Viridescent is both Shikanoin Heizou's best personal damage set, but also his best set for supporting the team.


# === characters.#heizou.roles.#em_dps.name ===

em dps


# === characters.#heizou.roles.#em_dps.notes ===

Shikanoin Heizou does not get the same benefits from an EM build as other anemo users do. He still has to level his talents, and allocate substats into offensive substats such as attack and crit to equal Anemo DPS. However it is notiably better than Anemo DPS build if used in Electro-Charged teams.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**<br>
**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**
Only use this set if you already have a [Viridescent Venerer (4)](#artifact:viridescent-venerer) user on your team.


# === characters.#heizou.roles.#support.name ===

support


# === characters.#heizou.roles.#support.notes ===

Support Shikanoin Heizou forgoes his personal damage for support capabilites. However, none of Heizou's support abilities are dependant on his stats and instead comes in the form of a flat 80 elemental mastery to all party members. He can run any artifacts to help his DPS.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Hakushin Ring](#weapon:hakushin-ring)**
In electro-charged teams, this can be used to buff both anemo and electro damage, and scales well with refines. It is recommended to run Anemo DMG based artifacts on this build.

**[Prototype Amber](#weapon:prototype-amber)**
In teams where there is no healer, Shikanoin Heizou can use this weapon to help the team's survivability.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige) or [Instructors (4)](#artifact:instructor)**
Only use this set if you already have a [Viridescent Venerer (4)](#artifact:viridescent-venerer) user on your team.



# === characters.#sucrose.roles.#em_build.name ===

em build


# === characters.#sucrose.roles.#em_build.talents.notes ===

Sucrose's Talent Levels are not a necessity.


# === characters.#sucrose.roles.#em_build.tips ===

When utilized as a [Viridescent Venerer (4)](#artifact:viridescent-venerer) artifact set holder, make sure you **don't immediately swap away** after casting Skill/Burst, you need to be on-field when the swirl reaction happens for you to trigger the 4-set effect.


# === characters.#sucrose.roles.#em_build.notes ===

Sucrose's Ascension 4 Talent boosts the entire team's EM by 20% of Sucrose's total EM, this is why you want to stack as much Elemental Mastery as possible in her artifacts. As a support, most of Sucrose's value lies on her Ascension 1 and 4 talents, hence leveling her other talents (Normal Attack, Skill, Burst) is not required.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers](#weapon:thrilling-tales-of-dragon-slayers)<br>
This weapon does not provide any EM, however it overtakes the other weapons on the list when it comes to buffing your team. It offers 48% ATK boost to the character you swap to which is equivalent to 1 main stat. This buffs your DPS more compared to [Sacrificial Fragments](#weapon:sacrificial-fragments) which gives \~44EM, equivalent to only 2 substats.

[Hakushin Ring](#weapon:hakushin-ring)<br>
Is a good option for teams where Sucrose can swirl Electro to trigger its damage-boosting passive. In Electro-Charged teams, she can buff Hydro DMG% as well.

[Favonius Codex](#weapon:favonius-codex)<br>
This weapon can be useful if you value the extra energy generation from the passive. You may need to get a few crit rate substats to trigger the passive reliably.

There are some team compositions in which Sucrose's Elemental Mastery is not a priority, such as Freeze teams or an Anemo battery for Xiao. In such situations it's better for Sucrose to use [Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers](#weapon:thrilling-tales-of-dragon-slayers).

**Optimal skill duration for \[C0\]:** 7s, 9s or 12s.<br>
**Optimal skill duration for \[C1\]:** 9s, 11s or 14s.

**Melee Burst**<br>
 Only to be used in situations where you need only 1 rotation to clear as the ER requirement to maintain burst uptime is quite high (170-190%), you'll always want to start your rotations with Ranged Burst since it refunds energy to maintain your rotation well.

**Skill Combo**<br>
- 2 NA + 1 CA (Optimal)<br>
- 3 NA + 1 CA (Recommended)<br>
- 5 NA + 1 CA (Recommended combo if using Rust or Thundering Pulse)

**\*NA = Normal Attack, CA = Charged Attack**

The Optimal combo provides more damage but consumes more stamina. Recommended combo provides slightly less damage but is more stamina efficient.


# === characters.#tartaglia.roles.#dps.notes ===

The Weapon Rankings here are under the assumption that Childe is used with Bennett and Vaporizes his Burst, aswell as using the optimal attack combos listed in the Ability Tips section.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Polar Star](#weapon:polar-star)**<br>
Has varied performance depending on how many passive stacks you get. Getting 2-3 stacks at the start of your rotation can perform better than Thundering Pulse while getting no stacks can perform worse than Skyward Harp. This only applies if you are Vaporising Childe Burst together with Bennett. In teams without Bennett, Polar Star will always perform better than the other options. 3 stacks can be achieved by doing Skill + 1 Normal + 1 Charged Attack before setting up your Vaporize Burst. If your Skill is still on cooldown, a fully Charged Aimed shot against a riptide affected target, OR a Ranged Normal + quick Aimed shot gives 2 stacks (which can be followed by Skill for the 3rd stack).

**[Thundering Pulse](#weapon:thundering-pulse)**<br>
Slightly better than Skyward Harp depending on rotations - the more time you spend doing Normal Attacks, the more it pulls ahead over Skyward Harp, but it's not recommended to extend your Childe's melee rotation for this.

**[Viridescent Hunt](#weapon:the-viridescent-hunt)**<br>
Offers a valuable passive that helps a lot in grouping enemies, which can offer a ton of damage from Riptide.

**[Blackcliff Warbow](#weapon:blackcliff-warbow)**<br>
Due to inconsistency of gaining stacks, falls off compared to other weapons at higher refinements.

**[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)**<br>
Requires you to trigger its passive by hitting the enemy's weak points, falls off if compared with other options without the passive triggered.

**[The Stringless](#weapon:the-stringless)**
Main DPS Childe should only use this weapon in teams where you are Vaporising your Burst,** as the Elemental Mastery substat loses a lot of value in other teams. If Childe is being used as a Nuke Support only for his Vaporized Burst damage, R5 Stringless will rank just below Thundering Pulse. Note that the stringless elemental skill passive does not affect Childe's melee stance auto attacks.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Heart of Depth (2) ](#artifact:heart-of-depth)+ [18% ATK set (2)](#artifact:18%-atk)**<br>
This set is only about 1-2 substats behind Heart of Depth (4), you can opt out for this set instead if you already have decent pieces.

**[Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4)](#artifact:shimenawas-reminiscence)**<br>
Due to this set requiring Childe to have around 150% Energy Recharge to reliably burst every rotation, it falls behind the other options. However, it outperforms Heart of Depth (4) if used in a single rotation setting (ignoring ER).

burgeon


# === characters.#thoma.roles.#burgeon.talents.notes ===

For an EM-focused build, upgrading Thoma's talent levels isn't a necessity


# === characters.#thoma.roles.#burgeon.notes ===

This build focuses on using Thoma as a trigger unit for Burgeon reactions. A role he excels at because of his slow pyro application reducing the likelihood of creating Burning reactions and his shield reducing the self-damage from the aforementioned burgeon reactions.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Kitain Cross Spear](#weapon:kitain-cross-spear)** 
High refinement is recommended to further reduce Thoma's Energy Recharge requirements<br>

**[Dragon's Bane](#weapon:dragons-bane)** 
Becomes a more reasonable option when you have Thoma's C4.

# === characters.#thoma.roles.#support.name ===

support


# === characters.#thoma.roles.#support.subStats.notes ===

Crit Rate is an option when using [Favonius Lance](#weapon:favonius-lance).


# === characters.#thoma.roles.#support.notes ===

Thoma ideally wants to focus on shield over damage, and his burst uptime is required to achieve better shields, which is why he needs ER% on top of HP%.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Black Tassel](#weapon:black-tassel)<br>
At \[C4\], Thoma gains 15 energy when he fires his Elemental Burst. This effectively reduces his energy cost to 65 and makes it possible to use Black Tassel with ER sands instead of ER weapon with ER sands to furthermore strengthen his shield.

**Regarding Artifact sets**

**The Instructor (4)**
This set ideally works best in heavily reaction focused teams like Hu Tao vape where the Elemental Mastery is utilized well. But this comes at the cost of making Thoma even more difficult to build, since you have fewer potential substat rolls using 4star artifacts, and therefore less of a chance of hitting his Energy Recharge and HP goals.

quick swap dps


# === characters.#tighnari.roles.#quick_swap_dps.artifacts.notes ===

≈ [Gilded Dreams (4)](#artifact:gilded-dreams)


# === characters.#tighnari.roles.#quick_swap_dps.tips ===

There are three recommended combos that Tighnari can perform:<br>
1. Skill -> Burst -> Charged Attack (x3) — Simplest combo to use, and generally weakest combo. His Burst does not benefit from A1 in this combo.<br>
2. Skill -> Charged Attack (x3) -> Burst — Allows Tighnari's Burst to benefit from A1. However, this combo doesn't allow Tighnari to funnel particles from his Skill into his next Burst.<br>
3. Skill -> Charged Attack -> Burst -> Charged Attack (x2) — This is the most mechanically difficult combo. However, this combo allows Tighnari to have both his Burst effected by A1 and funnel particles from his Skill to his next Burst.


# === characters.#tighnari.roles.#quick_swap_dps.notes ===

Tighnari's standard build revolves around him doing his Elemental Skill, Three Clusterbloom Arrows, an Elemental Burst, and promptly swapping out to another character.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**<br>

**[Elegy for the End](#weapon:elegy-for-the-end)**
If Tighnari does not need the Energy Recharge that Elegy provides, this weapon will perform worse than **Amos' Bow** for his personal damage.

**[Amos' Bow](#weapon:amos-bow)**<br>
This option ranks lower due to Tighnari not needing as much ATK%, as well as not stacking the passive well.

**[Slingshot](#weapon:slingshot)**
Significantly worse when fighting from a long range.

**[Prototype Crescent](#weapon:prototype-crescent)**<br>
At refinement 5, this weapon is better than Slingshot.

**[The Stringless](#weapon:the-stringless)**<br>
At refinement 5, this weapon is equal to Slingshot.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**<br>

**[Deepwood Memories (4)](#artifact:deepwood-memories)**
This is by far Tighnari's best set if no one else on the team is using it.

Crit Rate / DMG will have higher priority for a full Crit build

# === characters.#traveler-anemo.roles.#anemo_dps.talents.notes ===

For an EM-focused build, upgrading Traveler's talent levels isn't a necessity.


# === characters.#traveler-anemo.roles.#anemo_dps.notes ===

This section is dedicated to utilising the Anemo Traveler's Elemental Skill / Burst. Due to how little field time this playstyle takes, the Traveler can also fulfill the role of a quickswap style Sub-DPS.

Anemo Traveler can require up to 160% Energy Recharge.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

Anemo Traveler can either go for a **full Elemental Mastery** build or a **full ATK/Crit** build without much difference in damage. The weapon rankings listed here will not change much between the two builds.

[Sacrificial Sword](#weapon:sacrificial-sword)<br>
This weapon's ranking assumes you make use of the passive Elemental Skill reset, however doing so will require you to stay onfield for a much longer period of time which may not be ideal sometimes.<br>

[Amenoma Kageuchi](#weapon:amenoma-kageuchi)<br>
This weapon reduces your ER% requirements to \~135% at \[R1\] and \~110% at \[R5\]. At \[R5\], this weapon will be better than Sacrificial Sword.

[Favonius Sword](#weapon:favonius-sword)<br>
Although this weapon does not provide much damage, the Energy generated by the passive can sometimes be more beneficial to your team. Make sure to build some amount of Crit rate to reliably trigger the passive.


# === characters.#traveler-anemo.roles.#physical_dps.name ===

[Pale Flame (4)](#artifact:pale-flame)<br>

Prioritize maintaining their burst uptime, the ER needs for Dendro Traveler would be a lot greater if they are the only Dendro unit in the team.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Sacrificial Sword](#weapon:sacrificial-sword)**<br>
Prioritized due to Dendro Traveler's exceedingly high Energy Recharge requirements for burst uptime consistency.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**
This option would generally be better than [Deepwood Memories (4)](#artifact:deepwood-memories) if Dendro Traveler is used in an Aggravate focused team.

**[The Exile (4)](#artifact:the-exile)**<br>
An alternative option if they are placed in the same team as Cyno to help his Energy Recharge needs.




# === characters.#traveler-electro.roles.#support.name ===

support


# === characters.#traveler-electro.roles.#support.mainStats.notes ===

Main stats aren't as important. Stack Energy Recharge for comfortable Elemental Burst uptime instead.


# === characters.#traveler-electro.roles.#support.tips ===

It is not recommended to level Elemental Skill and Burst past talent level 7 as the amount of energy generated does not increase.


# === characters.#traveler-electro.roles.#support.notes ===

Traveler can provide a lot of energy and Energy Recharge to the on-field character through their Elemental Skill pick up or Elemental Burst procs. This is especially useful with a damage dealer that doesn't conflict with traveler's element and can benefit from the abundance of energy. Due to the low damage scaling on Electro Traveler's Elemental Skill and Burst, its recommended to build Electro Traveler by just stacking Energy Recharge to amplify the batterying power.

# === characters.#traveler-geo.roles.#geo_dps.name ===

geo dps


# === characters.#traveler-geo.roles.#geo_dps.notes ===

This section is dedicated to utilising the Geo Traveler's Geo Burst damage capabilities. As his Elemental Skill and Burst have high multipliers, short cooldowns, and require very little field time, the Traveler is recommended to be played as a quickswap style Sub-DPS.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

The weapon ranking is considering KQM standard with Geo resonance and Noblesse (4) buff. Read the In-depth Guide for more insight on different scenarios.

**[Summit Shaper](#weapon:summit-shaper)**<br>
As this weapon gives so much attack, it suffers greatly from opportunity cost when many ATK buffs are present (i.e. Bennett).

**[Lion's Roar](#weapon:lions-roar)**<br>
It's placement on this list assume a 100% passive uptime. This weapon is only recommended if run with teammates that can maintain a pyro/electro aura consistently. (i.e. Xiangling, Raiden, Fischl)

**[Festering Desire](#weapon:festering-desire) and [Skyward Blade](#weapon:skyward-blade)** 
These weapons help in bursting off cooldown, but if you're not having issues with energy, then these weapons falls behind in terms of damage.

**[Favonius Sword](#weapon:favonius-sword) or [Sacrificial Sword](#weapon:sacrificial-sword)**
While this weapon is subpar in terms of damage, it can be a good choice for the Traveler to provide more energy to the team. For a Geo only team, a Sacrificial Sword \[R4\] would provide slightly more energy, at the cost of a slightly longer rotation.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Thundersoother (4)](#artifact:thundersoother) or [Lavawalker (4)](#artifact:lavawalker)**<br>
These sets will provide the highest personal damage only if their 4 piece set effects can be kept active consistently (i.e. with a consistent pyro/electro aura from Xiangling/Raiden/Fischl).

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**<br>
This set focuses more on providing an ATK buff to the team than the Traveler's personal damage. It can be paired with a Favonius/Sacrificial Sword for the Traveler to provide more utility to the team.

Crit Rate / DMG isn't as important in a triple EM build, which is what is assumed here.


# === characters.#venti.roles.#off-field_dps.talents.notes ===

For an EM-focused build, upgrading Venti's talent levels isn't a necessity.


# === characters.#venti.roles.#off-field_dps.tips ===

Make sure you don't immediately swap away after casting Burst, you need to be on-field for VV 4-set perk to proc on swirl first.(E > Q to avoid this issue)

You can infuse elements onto Venti's Burst if you walk up with an element status on you. (e.g. Bennett Burst > Venti Burst > Walk up to infuse Pyro)

Check out [this link](http://tinyurl.com/ventiburstinfo) to see which characters can hit the enemies sucked and ragdolled in Venti's burst.


# === characters.#venti.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

This build focuses on damage over ER because of his ER ascension stat. This weapon order is in the assumption of EM Venti, as Crit Venti's damage potential is limited to either extremely high investment or single target situations. Consider reading the In-depth Guide from KQM if you're interested in a Crit-focused build.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Favonius Warbow](#weapon:favonius-warbow)<br>
While terrible for personal damage, this weapon allows Venti to provide more energy for his teammates, while also covering his ER needs. Finding Crit Rate in substats is recommended for consistent passive procs.

[Skyward Harp](#weapon:skyward-harp)<br>
Due to EM build assumptions, the stats offered aren't very valuable.

[Elegy for the End](#weapon:elegy-for-the-end)<br>
Elegy for the End's ATK buff does not buff Venti's burst if Venti is the one equipping the bow, but the EM buff affects Venti's Swirl reaction. This is due to Venti's burst snapshotting his stats (excluding EM toward transformative reactions such as Swirl) at the time of cast. While an **\[R1\]** Elegy for the End yields slightly lower Venti damage compared to an **\[R5\]** Stringless (\~7% assuming 50% Elegy buff uptime), it provides a party-wide ATK and EM buff which can be better in terms of total team damage and comfortable ER.

# === characters.#wanderer.roles.#dps_(without_bennett).notes ===

Wanderer focuses on doing damage by activating his elemental skill and performing boosted normal attacks. It should be noted that in this state, he does not have knockback resistance so a shielder or other form of knockback immunity is recommended. It is not worth building ER to burst every rotation. Instead, bursting every other rotation is preferred.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**Memory of Dust**
This weapon can pull farther ahead than other options if Wanderer is shielded. If shielded, it maintains its ranking without Bennett, and performs better than The Widsith with Bennett.<br>

**Dodoco Tales \[R5\]**
This weapon uses a different rotation of E N1 CAx6 N1 CAx6 to maximize its passive. <br>

**The Widsith**
Because Wanderer doesn't focus on swirl damage, this weapon can be inconsistent if you get the EM buff.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**Echoes of an Offering (4)**
If your ping is above 100, it is not recommended to run this set specifically

**Blizzard Strayer (4)**
This set synergizes well with the 20% crit rate that Wanderer gets from swirling cryo. It is only recommended if you have close to 100% uptime on freeze, which requires very specific teams. Despite this, with 100% Freeze uptime, this set is still worse than Desert Pavillion Chronicles (4)

**Lavawalkers (4)**
In teams with consistent pyro application, this set is about equal to **Echoes of an Offering (4).

**Viridescent Venerer (4)**
In teams where the majority of the damage share is not linked to Wanderer, and there is no other viable holder of the set, he may use Viridescent Venerer (4).

# === characters.#xiangling.roles.#off-field_dps.name ===

off-field dps


# === characters.#xiangling.roles.#off-field_dps.tips ===

A few commonly used teams for pyro Xiangling are:

**National Team:** Xiangling, Xingqiu, Bennett and a Flex unit (Sucrose/Zhongli/Kazuha/Raiden/Chongyun/etc)

**Childe Team:** Childe, Xiangling, Bennett and a Flex unit (Sucrose/Zhongli/Venti/Kazuha/etc)

**Recommended ER thresholds:**

**National/Childe Teams:** 160-200 ER%<br>
**Enabler for Reverse Melt teams:** 200-250 ER%


# === characters.#xiangling.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**THIS LIST ASSUMES THAT XIANGLING IS RUN WITH BOTH BENNETT AND A SECONDARY BUFFER (i.e. Kazuha/Sucrose)**

[Wavebreaker's Fin](#weapon:wavebreakers-fin)<br>
\[R5\] Wavebreaker's Fin is equal to or outperforms Staff of Homa, depending on your total team burst cost.

[Dragon's Bane](#weapon:dragons-bane)<br>
\[R5\] Dragon's Bane outperforms Primordial Jade-Winged Spear.

[Kitain Cross Spear](#weapon:kitain-cross-spear)<br>
Kitain Cross Spear's passive reduces the ER threshold of Xiangling greatly, down to \~140 ER% at \[R1\] and \~110 ER% at \[R5\]. This allows you to distribute ER rolls into otherwise offensive substats and due to this, an \[R5\] Kitain Cross Spear can outperform Primordial Jade-Winged Spear. Due to lowering ER thresholds so much, the Crimson Witch of Flames (4) artifact set will outperform Emblem of Severed Fate (4).

[Lithic Spear](#weapon:lithic-spear)<br>
\[R5\] Lithic Spear with 2 stacks performs equal to Primordial Jade-Winged Spear.

[Favonius Lance](#weapon:favonius-lance)<br>
The utility provided from a highly refined Favonius Lance can make it a weapon of choice in a team comp where Xiangling is not triggering the reaction and is instead used as an aura. (i.e. Reverse Melt teams)

**Regarding Weapons and Artifacts with EM stat**

[Dragon's Bane](#weapon:dragons-bane) / [Kitain Cross Spear ](#weapon:kitain-cross-spear)**/ EM substats**<br>
In team comps where you can trigger both Vaporize and Overload at the same time (i.e. Raiden National), Elemental Mastery gets more value, pushing these weapons and artifacts ahead in damage.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Crimson Witch of Flames (4)](#artifact:crimson-witch-of-flames)**<br>
This set can be competitive with Severed Fate (4) on team comps where Xiangling triggers Overloads in addition to Vaporize (i.e. Raiden National).

**[The Exile (2) Scholar (2)](#artifact:the-exile)**<br>
This set can be used as a very low investment support build to enable Reverse Melt team comps where Xiangling is not triggering the reaction and is instead used as an aura and needs a lot of Energy Recharge. Note that it is not recommended to stay on this build as Xiangling can still contribute respectable damage with offensive stats.


# === characters.#xiangling.roles.#physical_dps.name ===

physical dps


# === characters.#xiangling.roles.#physical_dps.notes ===

**It is not recommended to run Physical DPS Xiangling since Xiangling excels more as an Off-field Pyro DPS.** Physical Xiangling is only good for early game.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Crescent Pike](#weapon:crescent-pike)<br>
Crescent Pike is extremely strong on Xiangling due to the nature of her attack combo, Crescent Pike continues to surpass Primordial Jade Winged-Spear in terms of Normal/Charge Attack Damage.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Pale Flame (4)](#artifact:pale-flame)<br>
The passive from this set can have 100% uptime through using Guoba off cooldown.


# === characters.#xiao.credits ===

[In-depth Guide](https://keqingmains.com/xiao/) from Xiao Mains + KQM


# === characters.#xiao.roles.#dps.name ===

dps


# === characters.#xiao.roles.#dps.tips ===

**Regarding Xiao's Optimal Skill Rotation**<br>
Skill -> Skill -> Burst -> Plunge Combo

**Regarding Xiao's Plunge Combo**

**Best combo for Xiao when fighting a single target**<br>
Plunge -> Normal Attack -> Charged Attack -> Plunge

**Best combo for Xiao when fighting multiple enemies**<br>
Plunge -> Normal Attack -> Plunge


# === characters.#xiao.roles.#dps.notes ===

Xiao has issues with Energy regeneration because **he cannot generate any particles with his Elemental Skill while his Burst is active,** so it is not suggested to use his Elemental Skill during Elemental Burst.

Start off a fight by casting the skill of your Anemo Battery and then casting his skill twice then cast your burst immediately. You will want to be half way through your burst animation before the particles reach you, so this way you can start off your burst with a portion of the energy gauge already filled.

**You'll want to pair Xiao with another Anemo character** (Venti, Sucrose, Jean or Anemo Traveler) to help him gain energy while his Elemental Burst is on cooldown. Xiao's Elemental Burst ends when you swap to another character. Although he has two charges of his Elemental Skill, only ONE charge comes back per cooldown.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

With a proper anemo battery (e.g. Sucrose), Xiao needs as little as 120-130% ER to maintain a high burst uptime. In these scenarios, unless there are no ER from substats, you should always go for a non-ER weapon as it will result in more damage.

**[Calamity Queller](#weapon:calamity-queller)**<br>
This weapon has a really high Base ATK, which means you benefit more from ATK% buffs (e.g. Thrilling Tales of the Dragon Slayers) if compared with other weapons.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**Desert Pavillion Chronicle (4)**
If Xiao has a weapon with low base attack in a team with a lot of external ATK buffs like Bennett or Thrilling Tales of the Dragons Slayers this artifact set can be equal to or better than Vermillion Hereafter (4)

Prioritize Viridescent Venerer (2) over the other 2 +18% ATK sets if there are external ATK% buff sources on your team.


**Regarding Artifact Main Stats**

Anemo DMG% goblets are recommended for Xiao. ATK% goblets serve as a good alternative for him.

off-field dps (c6)


# === characters.#xingqiu.roles.#off-field_dps_(c6).subStats.notes ===

Prioritize Energy Recharge first if you can't burst off cooldown


# === characters.#xingqiu.roles.#off-field_dps_(c6).tips ===

Activating XQ's Elemental Skill or Elemental Burst applies Hydro to the on-field character with his shield. (Pyro in specific)

Cleansing Electro may take an additional switch for your character with the rain swords active, while Cryo would freeze you in place.

# === characters.#xingqiu.roles.#off-field_dps_(c6).notes ===

C6 stands for "Constellation 6" and C0-C5 refers to a Xingqiu that is not yet C6.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

The weapon rankings assume you are running enough Energy Recharge to get Xingqiu's burst up off cooldown. This is usually 150-170% ER for Sacrificial Sword, while \~190% ER for other weapons. ER needs can be found in the [Xingqiu Mastersheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wv1WXpkFkTX8SLCWLoQXlyxwnB2ZXZqQ6c9tSSVCAvQ/edit?usp=sharing)

**[Favonius Sword](#weapon:favonius-sword)**
This weapon is better than Sacrifical Sword \[R3+\] if you intend on using Xingqiu in teams where there is not a second hydro unit.<br>

**[Sacrificial Sword \[R3+\]](#weapon:sacrificial-sword)**
This weapon is better than Favonius Sword when running Xingqiu in a team with more than one hydro unit.

**[Harbinger of Dawn \[R5\]](#weapon:harbinger-of-dawn)**<br>
At constellation 6, if you can consistently keep the passive active, this has the potential to equal Favonius Sword or Sacrificial Sword \[R3+\].

**[Sapwood Blade](#weapon:sapwood-blade)**
This weapon can be useful as a support weapon in dendro based teams.

Big thanks to Quincy#6965 for helping us with [the weapons calculations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wv1WXpkFkTX8SLCWLoQXlyxwnB2ZXZqQ6c9tSSVCAvQ/edit#gid=0).

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Emblem of Severed Fate (4)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate)**<br>
This set falls off in terms of damage if Xingqiu has less than 130% energy recharge.

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**<br>
Offers party-wide ATK boost, you can use this set on Xingqiu if nobody else on the party is able to use it better.

**[Blizzard Strayer (4)](#artifact:blizzard-strayer)**<br>
This set is only recommended on a freeze team to optimize Xingqiu's stats since he can mildly disregard Crit Rate and build Crit Damage instead for more damage output. Despite it outperforming Emblem of Severed Fate (4) within this niche, it is generally not recommended to specifically farm for this set.

**[20% Energy Recharge (2)](#artifact:20%-er) and [20% Energy Recharge (2)](#artifact:20%-er)**<br>
This set is a cheap beginner option to maintain burst uptime well since it gives 40% Energy Recharge. Note that it is not recommended to stay on this set as Xingqiu contributes a lot of damage in his teams.

**Regarding Main Stats Priority**

Ideally you would be running ATK% Sands when your ER needs are fulfilled.

This build focuses primarily on her Physical Damage as an On-Field DPS. At \[C2\], she can build a 1:3 Crit Rate:Crit DMG ratio, instead of the usual 1:2 Crit Rate:Crit DMG ratio.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Serpent Spine](#weapon:serpent-spine)**<br>
At \[R5\], this weapon performs better than [Skyward Pride](#weapon:skyward-pride).<br>

[The Unforged](#weapon:the-unforged)
This ranking is based on unshielded performance, while shielded this weapon performs better than low refinement Serpent Spine.<br>

[Prototype Archaic](#weapon:prototype-archaic)

# === characters.#xinyan.roles.#pyro_dps.notes ===

It is required to run this build with \[C6\] Bennett. However, it is not recommended to \[C6\] Bennett solely for Xinyan.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Serpent Spine](#weapon:serpent-spine)**<br>
It is worth noting that an \[R5\] Serpent Spine can outperform [Redhorn Stonethresher](#weapon:redhorn-stonethresher) \[R1\] with good Serpent Spine stack management.<br>

**[Lithic Blade](#weapon:lithic-blade)**
This ranking assumes 2 stacks.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Lavawalker (4)](#artifact:lavawalker)<br>
Xinyan can maintain a high pyro aura uptime on an enemy, making this her best set.


# === characters.#xinyan.roles.#support.name ===

support


# === characters.#xinyan.roles.#support.tips ===

Xinyan's skill grants you a pyro status upon contact with shield. No matter how many times you switch your characters, it'll still apply pyro every instance you switch with shield. This allows you to cleanse most elemental statuses that has been applied to you.

If the status doesn't get cleansed, switch on that character one more time with the shield. Some elements, such as Hydro, are not cleansed very efficiently.


# === characters.#xinyan.roles.#support.notes ===

This section is dedicated to using Xinyan as a shielder for her team.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
If you can maximize the uptime of Xinyan's Level 3 shield, she can provide a constant 30% Shield Strength and 20% Atk boost to the team (as long as the pulses hit an enemy). This means that [Sacrificial Greatsword](#weapon:sacrificial-greatsword) and Xinyan's \[C2\] are crucial to making this set shine on her. This set isn't as recommended for her if you have neither of the two.

Shield uptime is also crucial to maximizing her Physical/Shield Support capabilities. If you have neither Sacrificial Greatsword nor at least \[C2\] (but ideally \[C4\]) on Xinyan, you may want to build her as a DPS instead of Physical/Shield Support.

Generally not recommended for Pyro Applications, as the pulses only happen at Shield Level 3, and are not very efficient at breaking Cryo shields.

# === characters.#yae-miko.roles.#off-field_dps.tips ===

Start your rotations with Yae's Elemental Skill to amplify her Elemental Burst damage.

**Burst combo**<br>
Skill > Skill > Skill > Burst > Skill > Skill > Skill
After the first set of EEE you usually swap out and go through your buff rotation before swapping back to burst.


Take note that none of Yae Miko's abilities snapshot.


# === characters.#yae-miko.roles.#off-field_dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Solar Pearl](#weapon:solar-pearl)**<br>
This weapon benefits a lot from refines and attack buffs like Bennett. \[R5\] Solar Pearl without buffs, or a low refine Solar Pearl with Bennett buff can perform similar to [Skyward Atlas](#weapon:skyward-atlas). Note that you should do a Normal Attack when you swap in and before you swap out of Yae Miko to keep good uptime on the passive.

**[The Widsith](#weapon:the-widsith)**<br>
In Aggravate teams specifically, this weapon ranks much higher and can outperform the 5 stars. Otherwise, it is recommended to use the other options above Widsith for more consistent damage.

**[Hakushin Ring](#weapon:hakushin-ring)**<br>
This weapon's passive can buff your other team members, which may be more beneficial than Yae Miko's personal damage depending on the team and rotation used. Note that the passive cannot be triggered when off-field.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Emblem of Severed Fate (4)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate)**<br>
This set works best for Yae in multi-target scenarios where her Elemental Burst hits multiple enemies and she is bursting every rotation. This set also provides more value if she's used WITHOUT Raiden (due to the higher ER requirements).

**[+18% ATK set (2)](#artifact:18%-atk) / [Thundering Fury (2)](#artifact:thundering-fury) / [Emblem of Severed Fate (2)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate)**<br>
Using a combination of these artifact sets works best for Yae in **single-target scenarios.** These also **provide more value** if she's paired WITH Raiden (due to lower ER requirements).

**[Thundersoother (4)](#artifact:thundersoother)**<br>
Assuming you are able to maintain 100% uptime on its passive, this is Yae's BiS set. This set works best for Yae in Electro-charged teams.

**[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
This set trades off a portion of Yae's damage in return for a party wide 20 ATK% buff. If you have good pieces as a result of farming Pale Flame (for Eula or otherwise) this can be a good option for her. Not recommended to specifically farm this set for Yae.

**Regarding Talent Priority**

Do note that Yae's Elemental Burst does more damage than her Elemental Skill when it hits multiple enemies, and in some setups requiring high ER its more efficient to simply ult every second rotation rather than try to stack enough ER substats.

Big thanks to _Fob#6835_ for helping us with [the weapon/artifact rankings.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kDgkF3ZCa6MiQJLFzSXVBqbLrhe-0fNk/edit#gid=606412994)


# === characters.#yanfei.roles.#dps.name ===

dps


# === characters.#yanfei.roles.#dps.tips ===

Yanfei's Ascension 4 Talent does a second hit after a Crit Charge Attack. This scales 80% of your ATK and can trigger reactions as well due to having a separate internal cooldown on its pyro application. <br>


# === characters.#yanfei.roles.#dps.notes ===

Yanfei can have trouble trying to set up for her reaction DPS. Vaporize is generally the more consistent option and you need Xingqiu to make this work best. When running a Vaporize team with Xingqiu, 3 normal attacks into a charged attack (N1>N2>N3>C) is the safest and most reliable way to vaporize your charged attacks. Make sure you're applying hydro first before starting combos.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds](#weapon:lost-prayer-to-the-sacred-winds)<br>
Bennett buff/ Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer's buff + Noblesse Oblige (4) will push Lost Prayer ahead of Skyward Atlas and Memory of Dust

[Kagura's Verity](#weapon:kaguras-verity)<br>
Do note that with Bennett's Buff / Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer's buff + Noblesse Oblige (4), Kagura's Verity will push ahead of Skyward Atlas and Memory of Dust.

[The Widsith](#weapon:the-widsith)<br>
Note that with strong attack buffs like Bennett's Burst, an \[R5\] Widsith can outperform most \[R1\] 5-star weapons, with the exception of Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds.

[Dodoco Tales](#weapon:dodoco-tales)<br>
On equal refinements, Widsith is better than Dodoco Tales, but assuming it's \[R5\] Dodoco Tales vs \[R1\]-\[R3\] Widsith, \[R5\] Dodoco Tales is better. Note that Bennett buff / Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer's buff + Noblesse Oblige (4) buff may push Widsith and Solar Pearl above Dodoco Tales, even at low refinements.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

[Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4)](#artifact:shimenawas-reminiscence)<br>
Yanfei will rarely have her burst up due to the 15 energy cost on the 4-piece effect, however she can instead **maintain the 4-piece DMG buff over a longer duration, making this set a good alternative to the other options.** Note that this set loses out on some value at higher constellations, as she can't get her **\[C4\]** effects without casting Burst.

**[Gilded Dreams (4)](#artifact:gilded-dreams)**<br>
Actually her BIS if used in a full Elemental Mastery build with a overload team.<br>

[Retracing Bolide (4)](#artifact:retracing-bolide)<br>
Running Yanfei with a shield character also allows you to make use of a full Retracing Bolide (4) as a placeholder until you're able to find a good Crimson Witch of Flames (4).

**Regarding Artifact Substats Priority**

Energy Recharge is prioritized over Elemental Mastery here since she has an 80 energy burst cost while her skill is also not very efficient at generating particles for getting it back. A major source of your energy will be coming from enemies as well as potential pyro batteries like Bennett, so be sure to have her pick the particles up as off-field characters only get 0.6x the value of the particles.

# === characters.#yelan.roles.#high_energy_recharge_(off-field_dps).notes ===

Yelan is an off-field DPS who is able to apply Hydro off-field via her Elemental Burst, this part of her kit acts similarly to Xingqiu's Elemental Burst. Yelan mainly scales off HP%, so don't build her with ATK%. Yelan also wants a lot of Energy Recharge to be able to maintain her Elemental Burst uptime (up to \~250 ER), this can decrease depending on the number of Hydro units or energy providers in the team.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Elegy for the End](#weapon:elegy-for-the-end)**<br>
This weapon is to be used only in reaction based comps such as Vape Hu Tao, Yelan's personal damage is lower than other options on this list, but is more beneficial for the team's damage per rotation.

**[Mouun's Moon](#weapon:mouuns-moon)**<br>
This weapon works best at \[R3\]+ and makes HP% Goblet potentially a stronger option instead of Hydro Bonus especially in comps with strong DMG% buffs.

**Sacrifricial Bow**
This ideally needs to be at refinement \[R3-R5\] to function properly in most Yelan teams rotations without desyncing the rotation and extending her field time.

**Aqua Simulacra**
Can still perform well at high Energy Recharge as long as your minimum requirements are met.

**Hunter's Path / Polar Star / Thundering Pulse** 
They are usable on Yelan, but she doesn't take full advantage of them. It is recommended to use them on characters who benefit more from their passives.

**Regarding Artifact Main Stats**

**Goblet**
HP% Goblet is to be used only if the Hydro DMG% option has terrible substats and HP% option has great substats, or if Yelan has strong DMG% buffs such as [Emblem of Severed Fate (4)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate) + Mouun's Moon (especially with refinements) or Raiden + Kazuha and so on.

On top of that it's never recommended to run more than 2 HP mainstat artifacts at a time.

**Regarding Talent Priority**

**Normal Attacks**
Level this up only if you want to constantly use her Breakthrough Barbs.

# === characters.#yoimiya.roles.#dps.name ===

dps


# === characters.#yoimiya.roles.#dps.notes ===

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

**[Aqua Simulacra](#weapon:aqua-simulacra)**
This weapon requires Yoimiya to be very close to enemies (\~8m). As such, this weapon is recommended only with a good shielder.

**[Slingshot \[R5\]](#weapon:slingshot)**
This ranking is assuming you're using either Yun Jin or Bennett in your team. While using both Yun Jin and Bennett, this weapon can potentially beat [Rust \[R5\]](#weapon:rust).

**[Amos' Bow](#weapon:amos-bow)**
This weapon's ranking is assuming low stacks of its passive due to you ideally being close to enemies to consistently hit all attacks in your combo. When at 3 stacks, this weapon can be close to Slingshot \[R5\]. Use it if it's already built for another character and you don't want to invest in Slingshot just for Yoimiya.

**[Rust](#weapon:rust)**
At \[R4\] this weapon performs better than [Polar Star](#weapon:polar-star), and at \[R5\] performs better than Aqua Simulacra.

**Regarding Artifacts**

**[Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4)](#artifact:shimenawas-reminiscence)**<br>
This set is her Best in Slot in the vast majority of situations even when considering inconsistent Burst usage (once every 3-4 rotations).

**[Crimson Witch of Flames (4)](#artifact:crimson-witch-of-flames)**
Usable in Vaporize teams and can be her Best in Slot for teams where she procs Vaporize and Overload (such as teams with a Fischl flex or Fischl + Beidou taser core)

**[Echoes of an Offering (4)](#artifact:echoes-of-an-offering)**
This set has a lot of caveats that generally warrant it being a subpar choice. Its effects proccing is tied to your connection to the servers, so if your ping is above 100 and/or you have an unstable connection (fluctuations), you should avoid this set. Additionally, the RNG nature of its procs makes it unreliable in Vaporize teams as you can't guarantee it working on N1, N3 and N5 (her Vaporized hits).

**[Retracing Bolide (4)](#artifact:retracing-bolide)**
This set is only recommended to be used with a shielder. This set is also very resin inefficient, so its not recommended to farm for this set specifically.

**[Crimson Witch of Flames (2)](#artifact:crimson-witch-of-flames) and [18% ATK set (2)](#artifact:18%-atk)** 
While lacking in power compared to the other options, you will likely have good substats on the 2 piece combinations compared to a full 4 piece set which can compensate.

**Regarding Mainstats**

**Elemental Mastery**<br>
A good option if Yoimiya is **triggering Vaporize and/or Overload.** Having Bennett in the team favours Elemental Mastery sands slightly more than ATK sands, however it is recommended to just use whichever has better substats.

**Regarding Talent Priorities**

Her Skill has poor scaling which results in individual upgrades not affecting your damage much. Her Burst is also low priority due to it being used once every few rotations in some scenarios (such as when using [Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4)](#artifact:shimenawas-reminiscence) without an abundance of off field energy) which can reduce its effectiveness.

Yun Jin is a Support character for Normal Attack focused characters who can deal off-field damage via her Elemental Burst. Yun Jin's **Elemental Burst grants nearby party members 30 stacks of additional flat damage bonus on Normal Attacks which scales with Yun Jin's current DEF.** This means that external DEF buffs like from Gorou's Elemental Skill and/or Burst doesn't provide much to Yun Jin since it only buffs active characters and not off-field ones.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Favonius Lance](#weapon:favonius-lance)<br>
With this weapon, try to aim for some Crit Rate stats to trigger the weapon passive reliably.

[Kitain Cross Spear](#weapon:kitain-cross-spear)<br>
Although the EM mainstat isn't useful for Yun Jin, the passive decreases her Energy Recharge requirements by alot, especially at higher refinements. It can reduce her ER% reqs from around \~20% at R1 to \~70% at R5.*Note that she must cast Elemental Burst first before Skill, as the passive drains 3 energy initially when Skill is cast. This weapon can be left at level 1 while still getting full effect from the passive.

**Regarding Artifact Main Stats and Substats Priority:**

Crit Rate should only be considered when Yun Jin is equpping Favonius Lance to reliably proc the passive.

**This kind of playstyle is very straightforward; stack as much HP as possible. Prioritize HP scaling polearms such as Black Tassel and artifact sets such as Tenacity of the Millelith (4) to capitalize on Zhongli's Shield.** Most of the time, especially on a HP-focused Zhongli, casting Elemental Burst is a DPS loss due to the cast time, which is why you'd only want to cast Elemental Burst for the Crowd Control it offers, and not for damage.

Note that if paired with Xingqiu and/or Beidou, the damage reduction from orbitals from Xingqiu's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst and/or Beidou's Elemental Burst can be utilized on Zhongli's shield, making it basically unbreakable.

**Regarding Artifact Main Stats and Substats Priority**<br>
Crit Rate should only be considered when Zhongli is equpping Favonius Lance to reliably proc the passive.

**Regarding Weapon Choices**

[Favonius Lance](#weapon:favonius-lance)<br>
Use this weapon over [Black Tassel](#weapon:black-tassel) if you value the team energy (Note that you need to build some amount of Crit Rate if you are running Favonius Lance to trigger the passive).

**Regarding Artifact sets**

**Archaic Petra (4)**
Can be more useful than Tenacity of the Millelith in teams that dont scale as well with ATK buffs or already have another Tenacity of the Millelith holder. Though it can be an awkard set to utlize well without extending rotation times, since the Holder of the set (Zhongli in this case) has to pickup the shard for the buff to take effect.

**Deepwood Memories (4)**
This set works best in dendro reaction focused teams (Bloom/Burgeon/Hyperbloom/Spread) that prefer having Deepwood Memories on Zhongli so that they can run more damage focused sets such as Gilded Dreams / Flower of Paradise Lost instead for the highest overall damage gain. That said it means keeping the enemies near your pillar's to have good uptime on the dendro resistance shred effect, which can be difficult with no grouping abilities in a team.

**The instructor (4)**
This set is usually only used in a few heavily reaction focused teams, such as Ganyu melt or Hu Tao vape, where you're maximising your damage in exchange for a stronger shield. Though Zhongli's shield is still usually more than strong enough even with fewer substat rolls to strengthen it.

# === characters.#zhongli.roles.#burst_support.notes ===

Zhongli can be utilized as a Geo Burst damage dealer due to his short Elemental Burst cooldown (12s) and low energy cost (40 Energy). His Elemental Skill Hold Cast (Shield) scales with HP and at Ascension 4, you would unlock a talent that allows your Elemental Burst to scale with 33% of Zhongli's Max HP, making him a great source of Shield and damage.

**Regarding Artifact Main Stats**

ATK sands provides more damage than HP sands, but it does have lesser Shield HP. If you want more Shield HP, you can consider running a HP sands.

**Regarding Artifact Sets**

**[Noblesse Oblige (2)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige) + [Archaic Petra (2)](#artifact:archaic-petra)**<br>
On lower ER requirements where Zhongli doesn't need to worry about his energy needs, this set pulls ahead of [Emblem of Severed Fate (4)](#artifact:emblem-of-severed-fate).

**[Noblesse Oblige (4)](#artifact:noblesse-oblige)**<br>
This set provides Zhongli more utility when casting his Elemental Burst, you can use this set on Zhongli if there is nobody else on the team who's equipping this set.

**[Tenacity of the Millelith (4)](#artifact:tenacity-of-the-millelith)**<br>
Just like Noblesse Oblige (4), this set provides Zhongli with more utility if his Elemental Skill hits an enemy. This set also provides Zhongli with stronger shields.
