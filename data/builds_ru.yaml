        tips:
          - p: Bennett's EB grants you a pyro status as long as your characters are within
              his burst AoE (Крио in specific, since Pyro > Крио).
          - p: For that, cast EB with Bennett, switch to the character imbued with Крио и
              walk on Bennett's Burst field
          - p: Upon entering burst field, the Pyro status will continuously imbue you with
              Pyro, reacting with other elements on you и eventually removing
              them.

                passive is disabled for 5 seconds и you could be losing out a

                Pyro Damage Bonus will always be the best for cup. The combo for the highest Melt/Vaporize damage is The Black Sword и Мастерство стихий sand.

              - " Iron Sting и Мастерство стихий sand turns out to have diminishing returns

              - " This set "

                 as it allows Bennett to accomplish 2 things: 
                1) Rapidly spam E for raw pyro damage + overload
                2) Generate tons of energy for the entire team.

              - b: It's worth noting that the main-stat artifacts you want to farm for 4-TF
                  Bennett varies from the main-stat artifacts you'd normally go
                  for in other builds.
              - " "
              - b: Instead of Сила атаки/Мастерство стихий, Pyro, и Crit, you'd instead want to go for Мастерство стихий/Pyro/Мастерство стихий on
                  a 4-TF Bennett.
              - " As such, this also means weapons that have Мастерство стихий substats such as
                Iron sting take priority over other swords."
          - p:
              - >-
                It is also worth noting that with 4 TF, Primordial Jade Cutter
                is able to overtake MIstsplitter Reforged due to its massive
                Шанс крит. попадания% substat, which allows you to vape consistently
                despite the lack of Крит. урон/Шанс крит. попадания subs in your artifacts.
                This assumes that your Мастерство стихий mainstat pieces (sands, goblet, и
                circlet) lack Шанс крит. попадания substats. However, in the rare occasion
                that your Мастерство стихий pieces manage to roll plenty of Crit subs,
                Mistsplitter easily overtakes Jade Cutter.

                Recommended amount of Восст. энергии%: 130-150%. Worth noting that 
              - b: with Thundering Fury (4), you have a lot more leeway when it comes to Восст. энергии.

                  Regarding Weapon Choices:
                  Mistsplitter Reforged, Aquila Favonia:
              - >2
                 These weapons have the highest Базовая атака in the game which is why it is ranked quite high. It is assuming you have enough Energy Recharge so you still can burst off cooldown for the maximum Сила атаки buff.
              - b: "Freedom-Sworn:"
              - >2
                 In comps where Bennett can reliably trigger reactions (и thus trigger this sword's passive), the buffs provided by this weapon will be stronger than Aquila Favonia.
              - b: "The Alley Flash: "
              - >
                This weapon currently has the highest Базовая атака for a 4 star
                weapon (even more Базовая атака than some 5 stars like Skyward
                Blade).
              - b: "Prototype Rancour: "
              - This weapon has one of the highest Базовая атака for a 4 Star weapon
                (и this is also a weapon you could craft from the Blacksmith)

        tips:
          - p: Xinyan's ES grants you a pyro status upon contact with shield. No matter how
              many times you switch your characters, it'll still apply pyro
              every instant you switch with shield. This allows you to cleanse
              every single elemental status that has been applied to you.
          - p: If the status doesn't get cleansed, switch on that character one more time
              with the shield. Pyro doesn't cleanse Гидро very efficiently, take
              Cecilia Garden for example, you'll have to apply pyro on your
              character 4 times before actually cleansing the hydro status.

          Yanfei's Ascension 4 Talent does a second hit after a Crit Charge
          Attack. This scales 80% of your Сила атаки и can trigger reactions as well
          due to having a separate internal cooldown on its pyro application. 
        notes:
          - p: Yanfei can have trouble trying to set up for her reaction ДПС. Vaporize is
              generally the more consistent option и you need Xingqiu to make
              this work best. When running a Vaporize team with Xingqiu, 3
              normal attacks into a charged attack (N1>N2>N3>C) is the safest
              и most reliable way to vaporize your charged attacks. Make sure
              you're adding applying hydro first before starting combos.

                  Regarding Artifact Set:
                  Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4): 
              - "Yanfei will rarely have her burst up due to the 15 energy cost
                on the 4-piece effect, however she can instead "
              - b: maintain the 4-piece DMG buff over a longer duration, making this set a good
                  alternative to the other options.
              - " Note that this set loses out on some value at higher

                 effects without casting Burst.
              - b: "Retracing Bolide (4): "
              - Running Yanfei with a shield character also allows you to make
                use of a full Retracing Bolide 4-set as a placeholder until
                you're able to find a good Crimson Witch 4-set.
          - p:
              - b: |
                  Regarding Artifact Substats Priority: 
              - Energy Recharge is prioritized over Elemental Mastery here since
                she has an 80 energy burst cost while her skill is also not very
                efficient at generating particles for getting it back. A major
                source of your energy will be coming from enemies as well as
                potential pyro batteries like Bennett, so be sure to have her
                pick the particles up as off-field characters only get 0.6x the
                value of the particles.

                Мастерство стихий boosts Diluc's reaction damage by a lot after all. Note that
                when Diluc's Pyro imbued basic attack is active, he can trigger
                Vaporize every 2 basic attacks due to internal cooldown.

        tips: Klee's Attacks have a 50% chance of spawning a floating star. Floating
          star removes the stamina cost for the next Charged Attack и
          increases 50% of its damage.

          - p: Extremely squishy, Klee requires great positioning. Being tiny, this is hard

                clunky Klee's attack animations are, it's hard to put this in
                actual practise as it requires you to dodge more и consume
                more stamina, not to mention how the ДПС gets caught up by the
                other builds mentioned above.

              reactions which utilizes her BiS Set, Crimson Witch of Flames (4).
              Freeze Melt refers to freezing enemies for Melt set up, since

              - "Provides little to nothing to Hu Tao since she scales better

                  White Tassel:

          - p: There is an animation cancelling technique with Fischl ДПС. After 3 or 5
              basic attacks, shoot an Aim Shot to reset your attack combo. The
              faster you can do this, the better it is. Only use this for
              animation cancelling when you're out of stamina since it can be
              pretty hard to replicate consistently.

                Amos in a situation where there are crowds of enemies, although
                it's not as efficient towards massive single targets or really
                agile targets. It offers crowd ДПС that is severely lacking due

        notes:
          - p: Elemental Burst и Skill both summon Oz, so make sure you're only using one
              at a time. Start with your Skill, use Burst for second Oz rotation
              и alternate. Hopefully, by the time your second/third round of

        tips: Beidou's skill grants you an Электро status for a brief moment upon
          holding it. This means it can be used for status-cleansing (No
          particular effective element). Can only be done on herself.

                  Serpent Spine outperforms Wolf's Gravestone by a significant

                  Redhorn Stonethresher: 
              - Depending on the amount of Сила атаки% buffs you're getting, this
                weapon can overtake Wolf's Gravestone in personal damage.

                 This set seeks to maximise your Burst damage in an Электро-Charged or mono Электро comps, take note that the set could be rendered useless when against enemies with non-Электро elements imbued.

                doesn't benefit from the Сила атаки buff from the 4 piece set if she's
                the set holder, so Beidou as a Noblesse Oblige (4) holder isn't
                really recommended.
              - b: "Scholar (2) The Exile (2): "
              - This set acts as a cheap beginner's option to provide Beidou
                with 40% Energy Recharge to help maintain her Elemental Burst
                uptime.

        tips: Lisa's Hold cast does not require 4 full seconds of charging to reach
          maximum damage threshold, as long as the indicator aligns with ring,
          you can release your cast at max damage.

              Can be built to set up for either Burst damage or Quickswap Skill

          burst is in-effect, that means it can be used for status-cleansing (no

        notes: Traveler can provide a lot of energy и Energy Recharge to the on-field
          character through their Elemental Skill pick up or Elemental Burst
          procs. This is especially useful with a damage dealer that doesn't
          conflict with traveler's element и can benefit from the abundance of
          energy. Due to the low damage scaling on Электро Traveler's Elemental
          Skill и Burst, its recommended to build Электро Traveler by just
          stacking Energy Recharge to amplify the batterying power.

                Both physical и electro keqing are good и viable. You'd usually want to decide which build to go for depending on your weapon gacha luck. For example, Lion's Roar = Электро, Flute will be equally good on Электро/физ., etc.

                  Thundering Fury (2) +18% Сила атаки set (2): 
              - >
                This set is a generalist set, which means it can be used
                generally anywhere, whether it be Co-op or Abyss, or other
                singleplayer content. This has a lot of consistency due to its
                independence from electro aura, и it is more viable in abyss.
              - b: "Thundersoother (4): "
              - >
                This set should be used with Электро-charged team compositions
                (Keqing + Xingqiu) or mono-electro team comp (Not Suggested).
                This set has a 35% Dmg modifier which increases all damage from
                all sources, although that modifier is a bit unstable due to its
                dependency to the sustainability of Электро aura on enemies.
              - b: "Thundering Fury (2) Noblesse Oblige (2): "
              - This set is used for Burst/Quickswap AoE Keqing. With this set,
                you'd want to be using Starward Sword (Q) all the time, which is
                your main source of ДПС with this set.

        tips: >-
          To make Mona's burst damage trigger the Vaporize 2.0x multiplier:

          1. Apply Pyro on enemy

          2. Cast Burst (should react и remove Pyro status on the enemy after using Burst)

          3. Wait 2.5 seconds for Mona's burst ICD (Mona should stay on field if you have Bennett, to keep the buff)

          4. Swap to Pyro character и apply Pyro on enemy

          5. Burst will pop after enemy gets hit, applying Гидро и vaporising her damage.

              only begins when the bubble is broken.
          - p: Frozen enemies can have their bubbles preserved as long as enemies stay in a
              frozen state. This technique makes Mona a priority Support for
              Freeze ДПС teams.

          Kokomi's Elemental Burst dynamically alters her skill's damage, this
          means that you cannot use her Burst to snapshot the buff onto the
          Skill и swap out.
        notes:
          - p: Support Kokomi focuses on just using her Elemental Burst before her Elemental
              Skill's duration ends to refresh her skill duration. This allows
              100% uptime on Гидро application from her Elemental Skill for
              Freeze / Электро-charge teams.

        tips: Diona's Elemental Skill grants you a cryo shield which allows cleansing.
          Every time you swap characters with the shield up, it applies cryo.
          This acts as a cleanse.
        notes:
          - p: The shielding Diona puts out should offset the need for healing from her
              burst. The damage boost from Noblesse Oblige (4) has more
              practical use. Additionally, her first constellation greatly
              increases her ultimate uptime, further lowering the healing
              needed.
          - p: As a support, Diona's typically used for three things; Shielding, Healing,
              и Крио particle generation. Pairing Diona with Крио carries such

          - p: Kaeya's Elemental Burst makes him an excellent source of Крио application for
              characters that often stay in melee range, although his burst
              can't be fully utilized with Reverse Melt teams due to how his
              Крио damage is split into a barrage of attacks.
          - p: In most teams, investment for damage is not a necessity, most notable
              examples are Razor teams и Hutao Xingqiu teams where his general
              purpose is to apply Крио, instead of being the damage dealer. This
              does not mean that he should not be invested, but is still useful
              even without proper investments.

        tips:
          - p: When using her Elemental Burst, place her Elemental Skill in the AoE to taunt
              и keep enemies inside the zone for constant damage.
          - p: Make sure to hit enemies with her skill's initial damage и her explosion
              damage as they both regen energy for her ult.

          - p: An Off-field ДПС Ganyu shines brightly on a Freeze comp as she has 100%
              Elemental Burst uptime и her Elemental Burst buffs party

                Her Elemental Burst also sticks on frozen enemies, but it also
                has a small hitbox so you need to position it well so that it

        notes:
          - p: People often compare Sucrose with Venti for Crowd-Control capabilities, but
              that's not what you'll be looking for. Sucrose is a character that
              can give Elemental Mastery to her teammates through swirling the
              correct elements (Ascension 1 Talent), which improves reaction
              damage for the Characters benefitting from the Мастерство стихий boost. Her
              Ascension 4 Talent also boosts the entire team's Мастерство стихий by 20% of
              Sucrose's total Мастерство стихий, this is why you want to stack as much
              elemental mastery as possible in her artifacts. As a support, most
              of Sucrose's value lies on her Ascension 1 и 4 talents, hence
              leveling her other talents (Normal Attack, Skill, и Burst) is
              not required.

                It's important to note that these weapons were ranked based on
                how much Мастерство стихий they offered you. However, this doesn't take into
                account how much each catalyst benefits your entire team's ДПС.
              - b: "Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers: "
              - This weapon does not provide any Мастерство стихий, however it overtakes the
                other weapons on the list when it comes to enabling your team.
              - b: >-2
                   It offers 48% Сила атаки boost to the character you swap to which is equivalent to 1 main stat. This enables your ДПС more if compared to Sacrificial Fragments which only gives ~44EM, equivalent to only 2 substats.
                  Widsith:
              - " This weapon is only useful if you get the Мастерство стихий passive from it.
                As such, it is "
              - b: not recommended for general gameplay
              - |2
                 but only if you want the highest possible Мастерство стихий buff.
              - b: "Favonius Codex:"
              - " This weapon can be useful if you"
              - b: " need Sucrose's Elemental Burst up as often as possible for grouping."
              - >-2
                 You may need to get a few crit rate substats to trigger the passive reliably.
                There are some team compositions in which Sucrose's Elemental Mastery is not a priority, such as Freeze teams or an Анемо battery for Xiao. In such situations it's better for Sucrose to use to Thrilling Tales of the Dragon Slayers.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Energy Recharge Priority:"
              - >-2
                 
                Ranking is based on the assumption that Sucrose has Sacrificial Fragments и is not valued for her Burst in teams that may not want Sucrose's Burst interfering with elemental auras. Energy Recharge could be prioritized higher when Sucrose is utilized in teams that don't really mind which element is being applied first и last (e.g. Электро-charged).

                  Regarding Artifact Sets: 
                  Pale Flame (4): 
              - When running this set, make sure you do Press Cast и not Hold
                Cast, as the Hold Cast Skill Cooldown would be too long for you
                to refresh your stacks.

        tips: Jean's Elemental Burst continuously imbues characters in zone with Анемо
          status, that means it can cleanse all elemental statuses aside from
          Dendro
        notes:
          - p: Jean's Elemental Skill can deal fall damage based off enemy's max ХП% и
              fall velocity if you aim it upwards. Do note that some 4 stars
              outdps Jean, Jean is better off as a Support.

          notes: It is worth noting that set bonuses do not increase Xiao's damage by
            much, due to an oversaturation on DMG% bonuses и Сила атаки% from various
            sources. For this reason, it is better to opt out for artifact
            pieces which have higher quality substats instead of trying to
            maintain a set bonus.

          - p:
              - "Xiao has issues with Energy regeneration because "
              - b: he cannot generate any particles with his Elemental Skill while his Burst is
                  active
              - ", so it is not suggested to use his Elemental Skill during
                Elemental Burst."
          - p: Start off a fight by casting the skill of your Анемо Battery и then casting
              his skill twice then cast your burst immediately. You will want to
              be half way through your burst animation before the particles
              reach you, so this way you can start off your burst with a portion
              of the energy gauge already filled. Same goes for any other Анемо
              Battery (recommended below), cast skill и swap back to Xiao to
              cast burst before the particles reach you.
          - p:
              - b: "You'll want to pair Xiao with another Анемо character "
              - (Venti, Sucrose, Jean or Анемо Traveler) to help him gain energy
                while his Elemental Burst is on cooldown. Xiao's Elemental Burst
                ends when you swap to another character. Although he has two
                charges of his Elemental Skill, only ONE charge comes back per
                cooldown.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Weapon Choices:"
              - >2
                 With a proper anemo battery (e.g. Sucrose), Xiao needs as little as 120-130% Восст. энергии to maintain a high burst uptime. In these scenarios, unless there are no Восст. энергии from substats, you should always go for a non-Восст. энергии weapon as it will result in more damage.
              - b: "Calamity Queller: "
              - This weapon has a really high Базовая атака, which means you benefit
                more from Сила атаки% buffs (e.g. Thrilling Tales of the Dragon
                Slayers) if compared with other weapons.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Sets: "
              - Prioritize Viridescent Venerer over the other 2 +18% Сила атаки sets if
                there are external Сила атаки% buff sources on your team.

                regular Сила атаки-Мастерство стихий/Анемо/Crit build as long as there are 2+ enemies
                due to the amount of swirls involved. Because of this, an ADC

        tips: Ningguang's Elemental Skill has a 6 second internal cooldown on generating
          energy, so for the sake of maintaining Elemental Burst uptime, wait 6
          seconds to cast again if you need energy. It also breaks when casted
          on top of another Гео Structure, you can intentionally use a structure
          to break your first screen.
        notes:
          - p: Due to Ningguang having a really low Базовая атака и no Сила атаки conversion
              mechanics, external Сила атаки buffers such as Bennett is recommended as
              a support for Ningguang to bump up her Сила атаки stat.

          provided from her A4 Talent.

          - p: A Burst Support Ningguang is basically a quickswap ДПС Ningguang, you don't
              do Normal Attacks & Charged Attacks as much, so your main source

                 Falls off a bit if compared to Skyward Atlas due to not being able to stack the passive reliably, but it's still a Crit weapon which makes stat building much easier.

                A really good Сила атаки statstick which can perform better than the
                other options if you don't consider external Сила атаки buffers like
                Bennett, Pyro resonance, etc, but falls off with it considered.
              - b: "Solar Pearl:"
              - " Due to Solar Pearl's passive being able to buff quite a huge
                percentage of a quickswap Ningguang's damage (Elemental Burst

                Useful if you are unable to get Восст. энергии from your substats. Does
                really well while its passive is active, but falls off in
                sustained fights. Comfort option that has quite a big power gap

              - Only recommended with high refines, as its usefulness scales

                self-battery assuming some additional particles from enemies,

                want to farm for Archaic Petra as Artifact Strongbox is much

        tips: Use her charged attacks for healing as they are much faster than normal
          attacks.

              extremely lackluster healing и poor shield uptime.

            seconds if you can obtain the required Crystallize shields. This
            allows his teammates to gain the 3 Гео 15% Гео DMG% bonus for a
            longer duration, so it's preferable to use Burst as your last
            ability before swapping into your ДПС.

              - "Gorou is a Support character that can give increasing buffs to
                your party members from his Elemental Skill и Elemental Burst
                based on the number of Гео characters in your team (capped at
                3). Casting his Elemental Skill sets up a banner which gives
                flat DEF (1 Гео), Interruption Resistance (2 Гео) и Гео DMG%
                Bonus (3 Гео) for your active character standing inside the
                banner radius. Casting his Elemental Burst creates a field
                following the active character which deals periodic damage и
                offers the same bonuses given by the Skill, destroying any
                placed banners in the process, it also pulls in nearby Elemental
                Shards created by Crystallize reactions. Due to his kit focusing
                on buffing DEF и Гео DMG, he's a specialised support geared
                towards Гео ДПС that scales with DEF, such as Noelle or Itto. He

                beneficial. Do note that this is a 4 star set so you're

                difference in mainstat value и 25% difference in individual

                 can be considered when Gorou is using Favonius Warbow to trigger the passive comfortably.

                being able to get Energy for his Burst is a lot more important."

          Skill и Burst have equal priorities.

          When using your Elemental Skill, try to use the hold variant of it over tapping, as it has a slight delay on the tap variant.

              - due to the Traveler's Elemental Skill cooldown being 6 seconds,
                which means the 4 piece set effect only kicks in 6 seconds into
                every rotation, и also gives the player a very little time
                window to keep up the 4 piece set effect.

              - Most of the time, especially on a ХП-focused Zhongli, casting
                Elemental Burst is a ДПС loss due to the cast time, which is why
                you'd only want to cast Elemental Burst for the Crowd Control it
                offers, и not for damage.

              orbitals from Xingqiu's Elemental Skill и Elemental Burst и/or
              Beidou's Elemental Burst can be utilized on Zhongli's shield,

          - p: Zhongli's kit is best utilised as a Гео Burst damage dealer for his short
              Elemental Burst cooldown (12s) и low energy cost (40 Energy),
              while his Elemental Skill Hold Cast (Shield) scales with ХП и at
              Ascension 4, you would unlock a talent that allows your burst to
              scale with 33% of Zhongli's Max ХП, making him an amazing source
              of shield и damage.

                  Emblem of Severed Fate (4): 
              - On higher Восст. энергии requirements, this set pulls ahead of Archaic Petra
                (2) Noblesse Oblige (2), however it's not recommended to stack
                Восст. энергии to fully benefit from the 4 piece set effect since by
                stacking Восст. энергии, you sacrifice other offensive stats.

                Zhongli's lackluster particle generation can be problematic in
                teams without a reliable source of Гео energy. With sufficient
                energy/Гео particles (i.e. in a dual Гео team) Lithic Spear и

                Ideally, you'll want Сила атаки%/Гео/Шанс крит. попадания-DMG for maximum Elemental Burst damage, as his Ascension 4 Talent scaling would be best benefitted using only one ХП main stat, any additional ХП stat is desirable as it goes to his shield durability/burst damage.

        tips: Albedo's Elemental Skill particle generation is completely RNG like
          Zhongli, but with better odds.
        notes:
          - p: Albedo is a character that can summon a Гео Construct from his Elemental
              Skill which deals damage on a 2 second interval whenever enemies
              in the field are damaged. His Elemental Burst provides 125 Мастерство стихий to
              the party, which is good on teams that rely on amplification
              reactions, such as Vaporize. It is worth noting that since his
              stat priority is focused on DEF (Elemental Skill scaling), you
              might want to skip casting Elemental Burst if your team doesn't
              benefit from the 125 Мастерство стихий buff. Another option is to build him with
              Сила атаки-DEF Hybrid, which ends up with lower Skill damage but higher
              Burst damage.
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Weapon Choices:"
              - "\n"
              - b: "Primordial Jade Cutter:"
              - >2
                 On a Hybrid build where Albedo casts his Elemental Burst, this weapon can be a better option than Cinnabar Spindle on certain situations, such as AoE where Albedo's Burst hits multiple enemies or when there are external Сила атаки buffs like Bennett's Burst. On a pure Elemental Skill focused Albedo or Single Target situations for Hybrid Albedo, Cinnabar Spindle is the better option, so choose wisely.
              - b: "Harbinger of Dawn:"
              - >2
                 Albedo's Elemental Skill scales with Defense, which is why the Базовая атака from the weapon doesn't matter that much. Harbinger of Dawn offers a lot of Crit stats which is why it is one of the strongest weapons for him despite being a 3 star weapon. The downside of this weapon is that you'd need to keep Albedo's ХП at 90% or higher to benefit from the passive, so it might be annoying to use against certain enemies which has a ХП lowering debuff, even when off-field, such as Corrosion.
              - b: "Mistsplitter Reforged:"
              - >2
                 Realistically you are only able to get 2 stacks of this weapon's passive и this requires setup. Generally just use Harbinger of Dawn instead и give your Mistsplitter Reforged to another sword ДПС character.
              - b: "Freedom-Sworn:"
              - " Equipping this weapon will decrease Albedo's own damage
                significantly but he is one of the better Freedom-Sworn holders
                since he can trigger the passive quite easily to buff your other
                party members."
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Sets:"
              - "\n"
              - b: "Husk of Opulent Dreams (4):"
              - >2
                 Due to Albedo's skill snapshotting upon cast, you need to either wait ~12 seconds before starting a domain/fight to reach max stacks or recast his skill to benefit from the DEF и Гео DMG bonus provided by the 4 piece set effect.
              - b: "Tenacity of the Milelith (4):"
              - >2
                 This set is used for the 4 piece set effect which has good uptime on Albedo. Worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.
              - b: "Noblesse Oblige (4):"
              - " If you don't have another character in your party that has
                this set, you can use this set on Albedo. You might want to get
                some Energy Recharge substats to maintain your Elemental Burst
                uptime for this. It is also worth noting that this set decreases
                your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other
                offensive sets."
          - p:
              - b: "Regarding Artifact Substats Priority:"
              - >-
                
                Сила атаки и Energy Recharge substats are only valuable on a Hybrid Albedo that casts his Elemental Burst.

        tips: []
        notes:
          - p: Arataki Itto is a Гео ДПС Character who takes advantage of his Elemental
              Burst's Сила атаки boost и Гео infusion to deal significant damage
              during its uptime. His combos involve stacking и unleashing his
              Charged Attacks, named Arataki Kesagiri. Arataki Kesigiri consumes
              no stamina и can be casted continuously as long as he has
              Superlative Superstrength stacks. Superlative Superstrength is
              capped at 5 stacks at any given time, и Itto gets those stacks
              when his 2nd и 4th Normal Attack string hits an enemy.
              Activating his Elemental Burst allows his 1st и 3rd Normal
              Attack to also generate stacks. Itto's Elemental Skill deals
              damage to enemies on cast и summons a taunt, Ushi, which is
              considered a Гео Construct. This initial cast damage grants Itto 1
              Superlative Superstrength stack, и upon Ushi leaving the field,
              Itto is granted another stack. When Ushi takes damage, Itto gains
              a stack (capped at 1 stack per 2 seconds). Itto's Elemental Burst
              converts his Normal и Charged Attacks into Гео DMG, increases
              Itto's Normal Attack Speed и converts a portion of Itto's
              current DEF to Сила атаки.

              - >2
                 When using Husk of Opulent Dreams, Serpent Spine stacks are prioritized over Husk of the Opulent Dreams stacks due to their conflicting nature in gaining stacks (Off-field и on-field).
              - b: "Skyward Pride: "
              - >
                Can be a great or bad weapon for Itto depending on your Восст. энергии
                needs. The less Energy Recharge you need (due to particle
                generation from your party members or Восст. энергии from subs), the less
                useful this weapon becomes.
              - b: "Whiteblind:"
              - " Your rotations often start with 1 stack of this weapon, и
                due to Itto's Burst snapshotting DEF on cast, you're unable to
