The monster was finally defeated. \nThe berserker sucked out the marrow of the monster's broken horn. This was how the victor drank to his success."},"circlet":{"description":"A hideous iron mask that has been left half-shattered from vicious battles.","story":"Bathed in the flames that devoured his
