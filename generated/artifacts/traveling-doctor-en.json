Emblematic of nocturnal supremacy, it gave some encouragement to the Traveling Doctor when venturing out to visit patients late at night.","story":"Even the pitch-black night could not stand between the traveling doctor and her patients. \nDanger lurks in every corner at night. Those who venture out must be as vigilant as the owl. \nBut unlike the owl, the endless nights without rest eventually took their toll on the traveling doctor, and she fell ill."},"sands":{"description":"A precise instrument used for keeping time. For a doctor, every second counts.","story":"When treating a dying patient, every second counts. \nThe accuracy of this watch had helped the traveling doctor turn the tide numerous times. \nBut as she lay alone on the sickbed in her final days, all she could do was savor its sound, each tick standing for one of the precious moments of life she had left. \nWhat used to be a tool to save lives now sang a final elegy for its owner."},"goblet":{"description":"This pot used to carry concentrated and extremely potent concoctions.

\nCome sun or rain, nothing could keep her from her work. \nThis handkerchief not only protected her messy hair, it also served as a bandage. \nIt saw her through all her hardships and became her most loyal partner on her journey."}}},"domains":[{"code":"valley-of-remembrance","name":"Valley of
