It holds the collective knowledge of the scholars. \nIt is inlaid with crystallized elements, which is what makes the Favonius Codex such a rarity. \nNot only because the elemental crystals are precious, but also because each Favonius Codex is hand-made. \nOnly scholars who have mastered the control of the elements can create such elemental crystals. "},{"p":"When the Knights of Favonius was founded, the Dawn Knight Ragnvindr turned the aristocrats' indoor baths into a library. \nIn time, countless contributions from bards, scholars and travelers turned the library into the largest collection of literature in the northern half of the continent. \nAfter all, songs are whisked away by the wind and wine's pleasure lasts but a fleeting moment. Only that which is committed to the page may sparkle and shine for eternity.
